  "i don't know him by that name, but yes.",
  "you think this will get me to move out?",
  "i mean, i always saw him as kind of...",
  "do you need to talk to someone or what?",
  "came in there a couple days ago.",
  "- i thought about it and i want to. - god.",
  "- okay, and who gave it to you? - some guy.",
  "besides, you know, it's a big deal to get picked for this.",
  "i was going to cut you in.",
  "- what? - for real, yo. get it out of here.",
  "and i don't know how i feel about that.",
  "- what's funny? - this old dude, he gave it to me.",
  "just have him put in one of those too.",

  "i'm just not the man i thought i was.",
  "you hear me? i got nothing to say. i told you, you can call my...",
  "i'm sorry. i can't go in there and lie. i'm not going to.",
  "now, this is not an easy decision, but it is one that i have to make.",
  "and i need to get you up to speed.",
  "oh, i think i'm gonna go wash my face.",
  "- get me a job there. - i know. he's great.",
  "i know you need to be with your family...",
  "...and he couldn't flunk me as long as i, you know, made the thing.",
  "i don't know. maybe it was the way he said it, but...",
  "- what did it do? - it got into the lab.",
  "no, no, it is here. it is around, okay?",
  "you know, we are who we are, mr. white.",
  "...it would help us come up with a plan on how to catch it.",
  "of course, i didn't know it at the time.",
  "i will show you exactly how easy it is.",
  "look, i'll get out of here if you want.",
  "but then i saw him like a week later.",
  "- i got you a new bed... - a hospital bed?",
  "...i would like to help you, if i could.",
  "i know it's not the right way and all...",
  "look at it and tell me if that's ours.",
  "you don't look at him. you look at me.",
  "we got a lot of those, but not this. this girl was scared.",
  "yeah, but we'll need a spare room for a study...",
  "of which, it seems to me, you have two.",
  "don't you hi, mama me. give me a hug.",
  "he does not wanna talk about it. and every time i bring it up with him...",
  "they tell me to bring you, i bring you. come on, get in the car.",
  "no, but i can't even get in my car. my car keys were on the same ring.",
  "yeah, and i just want to go on record",
  "you push that way, i'll hold him in.",
  "but i gotta believe you won't do that.",
  "and now he wants to buy my car wash.",
  "i noticed it the other day at the lab. you wear it if it makes you feel better.",
  "- yeah, but for how long?",
  "oh, i think we can help you out there.",
  "but any children? yes, as a matter of fact. a little boy.",
  "you need me to write it down for you?",
  "it was before the kids were in school, so it was easy to pick up and go.",
  "it looks big-time, but i'm no authority, so i wonder if you might take a look?",
  "and then we can, uh...",
  "how proud of you i am.",
  "if you ever want to talk, or you ever need anything...",
  "you are a piece of work, you know that?",
  "let's do it six more times.",
  "i mean, isn't that, like, idiotic for me to be out here without a gun?",
  "i mean, i'm here to do a job, right?",
  "and, i mean, yo, like, if i'm the guy...",
  "just as long as it gets the job done.",
  "ready, man. rip one off.",
  "i'm not sure. what do you mean?",
  "- i think last night was a cry for help. - oh, jesus.",
  "i know what it could do to this family.",
  "do you know how much i make a year?",
  "i know you think i was hard on you.",
  "oh, he does. he so does. what should he do?",
  "i like to think i see things in people.",
  "yeah, don't get me wrong, he's got a long way to go, but he--",
  "you don't want to see that dirty picture.",
  "if i had to put it in a word,",
  "it ain't no rock that made me do it.",
  "are you going to tell me",
  "oh, no. i hadn't seen gale for years until i ran into him a few weeks ago.",
  "i hope that i was of some small help.",
  "what did you ask him? what did he say?",
  "love to be the one to be able to take you there.",
  "...in the near future.",
  "i did. do you guys use that here? because it is the best.",
  "just grab me and go for it.",
  "he spent a lot of time in the hospital.",
  "she's sitting on the bed next to him so i can get a good look at him.",
  "i've got a man there who'll drive us the rest of the way.",
  "and i mean to keep it that way, so...",
  "i notice that this is for less than what i gave you, by the way.",
  "so way i see it, we're good to go. if this is still how you want to handle it.",
  "for now, all you have to do is worry about that.",
  "now it's left to me to deal with him.",
  "well, just know that i'll get there as soon as i can.",
  "how hard did you even try or did you?",
  "isn't that what you get paid to go get?",
  "there's no way in hell...",
  "i'm going to get that son of a bitch.",
  "so do i gotta call him or do you?",
  "let me talk to him. give me that phone.",
  "and he still just wants to talk to you.",
  "but if it's not a good time, i could -",
  "- i don't know how i could be so stupid. - stop that now. come on.",
  "i'm confused. am i under arrest here, or am i not?",
  "one of your guys is gonna roll...",
  "what do you want me to do about it?",
  "do whatever it takes to keep them out of here, or they die.",
  "it was a mistake made by a third party who has since been dealt with.",
  "how are we gonna fit a lab in here?",
  "so we pick the one that's best for us.",
  "much as i hate losing a good field man...",
  "what if we took the kids for a while?",
  "i can't even keep you out of my bed.",
  "hey, i just wanted to say i liked your idea.",
  "it's a stopgap. but right now, it's the best we can do.",
  "...how do we know we have the right one? and which tanker car is which?",
  "i think there is one.",
  "i want to be a real part of this.",
  "how about the fact that he shot a kid?",
  "this has been going on for a while now.",
  "and then i will be going on my way.",
  "and you want to take it away from me.",
  "you can at least do that for me, right?",
  "i don't know. a boat might be nice.",
  "so i guess this is it for a while?",
  "if you do that, then we just might have a fighting chance here, okay?",
  "i don't want to do this on the phone.",
  "i need you to pick up that bag and get it to me as soon as possible.",
  "i just wanna get my money and get out.",
  "do you have a list? do you have a list?",
  "it can be done exactly how i want it.",
  "...to take the kids home.",
  "...and wanna help you any way that we can.",
  "no, i was just in the neighbourhood, so i thought i'd drop by and say hello.",
  "he said they work, so i figured why not?",
  "and he has figured out a way to win.",
  "what are you you going for a hat trick?",
  "and there is nothing left for us to do",
  "look, i don't know what he did to you",
  "no, she is not. give her back to me.",
  "you had to come all the way out here?",
  "i had to see it with my own eyes.",
  "jesus. don't tell me how to do my job.",
  "and set you up with a whole new life.",
  "so, do i get to pick where i go?",
  "and i have to stop to get some gas,",
  "oh, no, no, no, no, no, kid. come on.",
  "and that you were next on the hit list. that's why you're here.",
  "to be fair, your circus clown of a boss did try to spare you for all of, what,",
  "tell us everything you know so we can get him before he gets you.",
  "as long as it takes to keep you safe.",
  "look, i want what you do to be quick and painless.",
  "the kid is not as dumb as you think.",
  "you hang up on me, put me on hold,",

  "i get it. you want to be the best.",
  "god, i do not love how this worked out.",
  "- can't wait to see it. - ah, here we go.",
  "i didn't close any on a piece of paper.",
  "okay, i can do that. it's no big deal.",
  "all the time, and he said i was great.",
  "what do you say we call off the bet",
  "so now i had a way into your office",
  "so pretty much the same as what i said.",
  "and if i see the lights on in here,",

  "is it a number one or a number two?",
  "a fun safe house is a safe safe house.",
  "and i mean that, from the bottom of my...",
  "so would you say he looks sort of like...",
  "we can get to know each other a little.",
  "i gotta say, the suit is growing on me.",
  "could be my dad's suit. he died in it.",
  "and i could be there in half an hour.",
  "i think i know what to do with them.",
  "for in eight hours, i will win the bet",
  "and only a few hours to do it in.",
  "he keeps saying he wants to talk to me.",
  "when he said that his choice to go back",
  "i know, but i want to play it out.",
  "and i don't want it to happen to them.",
  "and i would love to give them to you,",
  "oh, he told you to say that, didn't he?",
  "listen to me. i am with you all night.",

  "i don't want to mess up and ruin it.",
  "so i can do whatever i want to you.",
  "ah, i hate that i'm so by the book.",
  "thing is it's so hard to talk at work",
  "oh, i heard a pop! i heard a pop!",
  "is that bad? do you know if that's bad?",
  "for one of you old men to kiss me?",
  "i gotta say, out of the four of you,",
  "oh, you got it. i know you got it.",
  "and then you can get on with your day.",
  "i'm so sorry. i just got some bad news.",
  "as his friend, it's my job to stop him.",
  "i'm just here to give you a ride home",
  "and to prove to you, once and for all,",
  "how did you get her to change her mind?",
  "i already don't have to give it to you.",
  "so you wanted her to say no to us?",
  "do you guys feel this way all the time?",
  "only way to move on is to move on",
  "but this better not bite me in the ass.",
  "but i do have some good news in three,",
  "and the only way to prove it's not me",
  "wait, are you sure you want to do this?",
  "but, sir, i want to be captain one day,",
  "and told him to check in under my name.",
  "what? no! i gave my key to my mom!",
  "oh, i am as serious as a heart attack.",
  "if you wanted to get out of the house,",
  "i hear it. why would i ever say that?",
  "god! do you see what he's doing to me?",
  "oh, hey, i hope this is cool with you,",
  "all he wants to do with his free time",
  "and when i eat it, i feel as though",
  "and say you want to go straight to bed.",
  "this is why i wanted to write it down.",
  "and i need some 'cause i cut my hand.",
  "you have been a lie guy to us before.",
  "what in the world would i do with that?",
  "so are we gonna make a deal or what?",
  "or do i need to talk to your boss?",
  "no, we gotta go right now! go, go, go!",
  "we did it once. we can do it again.",
  "oh, i hate this song. i stand by it.",
  "at least three of us must be with him",
  "- you want to play? - yeah, i want to play.",
  "or you could just pay him what you owe.",
  "and he asked me to work it with him.",
  "but you don't have to wash them at all",
  "i'll go down there... are you mad at me?",
  "it's the rest of the money i owe you.",
  "oh, my god! this is such a huge deal!",
  "to say you love me for the first time.",
  "but go get him before i change my mind.",
  "but if you hurt my mom in any way,",
  "this is why i need to see the talk!",
  "i knew it was a dumb idea to invite",
  "and he thinks he can get away with it.",
  "and i will not be made a fool of.",
  "i mean, what am i supposed to do then?",
  "sure. i would do it, but it's bad luck",
  "just took you a while to get it right.",
  "or you could call her by her real name.",
  "let me try. we have to get this off.",
  "as much as i would love to do that,",
  "just blow up in my face half the time.",
  "i told him not to be cute about it.",
  "we just saw her making out with a guy",
  "i simply said what i wish had been said",
  "it's not a big deal. she's just a girl",
  "when you'd take me to dinner as a kid?",
  "got to admit, it was pretty nice of him",
  "i think you might be too close to this.",
  "which is why i am locked in for life.",
  "i got hit in the face with a box.",
  "why is it so fun to get hotel ice?",
  "i caught up on a lot of very important",
  "and no, i did not have a good time.",
  "i think you know what you've got to do.",
  "and why not hit the one down the street",
  "why don't you just get one of them in",
  "i could stay in these bad boys all day.",
  "yep, i am. no, i'm not gonna do it.",
  "of course, we have no idea where he is,",
  "i wish i could go back to middle school",
  "we go in strong and we go in fast.",
  "and i was hoping you'd help me move it.",
  "so how did you know she was the one?",
  "i want to say it has been a pleasure",
  "so what did you want to see me about?",
  "you are a person who will go out there",
  "yeah, and all eyes are gonna be on us",
  "i'd like you to be on the first one.",
  "and all i'm saying as a... if not the...",
  "i want to look smart when you say it.",
  "and they make fun of me... so i'm done.",
  "oh, i had no idea you felt that way.",
  "and i want to help you take him down.",
  "no, i mean, you know what would be fun...",
  "one on top, and then one on the front?",
  "damn it. that son of a bitch is good.",
  "hands in the air where i can see 'em!",
  "what was going on with the two of you.",
  "it's not the end of the world to feel...",
  "i'm going to try to work on that, so...",
  "you called us in here to tell us that?",
  "and it takes you where you need to be.",
  "you want me to tell you about the time",
  "is that what you want me to have done?",
  "it's me. i don't know why i did that.",
  "yeah, i know, but i need help on this.",
  "i just need to ask you a couple of...",
  "she told me you called me a gas giant.",
  "well, now you and i will never hook up.",
  "i do not want a repeat of last year",
  "no way i let you take that risk alone.",
  "thank you for the food in front of us.",
  "how did you even find out i wanted it?",
  "- it is not. - how did she get so much?",
  "to make good on your side of the deal,",
  "he's trying to have a baby. you get it.",
  "and then he opened up... gave me the name",
  "i tried to get him out of the house.",
  "take a look at what i got so far.",
  "but you can do whatever you want to me.",
  "before you both die or i will kill you.",
  "we have a case we need to work on.",
  "you bet. i hope you have a great time.",
  "look, i just want to see you two happy.",
  "you came to work last year on a horse.",
  "and now i have a friend with one arm.",
  "that my dad did, but she has no idea.",
  "how did i not know any of this stuff?",
  "and, yeah, it was as cool as it sounds.",
  "we need you to work this case with us.",
  "oh, it's just this thing we used to do",
  "in the face; you don't have to do it.",
  "no, i want to. i want to go first.",
  "i don't know what you want me to say.",
  "i know a real cool when i hear one.",
  "uh... no, i can do it myself, i'll just...",
  "i guess i could go back to that again.",
  "then i take him down to the break room.",
  "why do you wanna know?",
  "we only got one shot.",
  "he died a year ago; he was so rich,",
  "not if i have anything to do with it.",
  "but i don't know where i am, and my...",
  "i used to hang out there all the time.",
  "i've got a lot going on in my life,",
  "is that i seem like a very nice boy,",
  "i hope the guy in there is a cat.",
  "i mean, is it? no, i don't think so.",
  "ah, i would kill all of you for her.",
  "then we meet up and i get the money.",
  "sounds like i missed a hell of a week.",
  "- we need a new plan. - and i've got one.",
  "- i need to step to her. - step to her?",
  "pull myself back up the way i came in.",
  "- i knew we could. - and we did. to us!",
  "and now i'm going to have to kill you.",
  "yeah, it was fun. i moved the next day.",
  "doctor, do you need me to start a line?",
  "what if i never get to say so much?",
  "and we have to get out of here now.",
  "but we need to make the best of it.",
  "to get off my ass and get this job,",
  "i straight up said i was that guy who",
  "the only thing i need you to do is...",
  "it's all there if you want to count it.",
  "hi, i hear you're the man to talk to",
  "so i'm just gonna stay out of the way",
  "if we all sign it, they'll have to act.",
  "em, can you go ahead and show her out?",
  "what does the sad lady own two of us?",
  "okay, if you think i need to stop doing",
  "in forever, and i want to smell like a...",
  "and wonder if i was looking at it too?",
  "sorry, i was making a video for my son.",
  "we have the rest of our lives to talk.",
  "he needs me alive to get out of here.",
  "you know what... i do see it. it's bad.",
  "or see your loved ones or feel the sun",
  "and you will be home to see your kid.",
  "had a son, that's all he can focus on.",
  "oh, my god, this is a dream come true.",
  "am i just a piece of meat to you?",
  "i'm not gonna let you get away with it.",
  "can you do me a favor and tell me",
  "and now i'd like to say a few words.",
  "oh, we'll see who's a son of a bitch.",
  "look at all this crap. see, i told you.",
  "- all of them. - yeah, if you got a problem",
  "i guess if i had to pick one watch,",
  "i would love to work a case with you.",
  "yes. this is the best day of my life.",
  "to listen to an old man read a story?",
  "i don't know, do i have to teach you",
  "this is a start, but if you really want",
  "how the words i lived by my entire life",
  "- so i put in for it. - wait, you wanna",
  "all is not lost. we can still fix this.",
  "i'll put him in a car a block away.",
  "you want me to teach you how to kiss?",
  "i say we do it, and i'm the boss.",
  "i won't let you go in, i mean it.",
  "i am not gonna let you lose this bet.",
  "but i'm sure we'll get him to open up.",
  "but i like to sleep with the fan on,",
  "take a look at this map of the world.",
  "i just told him i saw one of them",
  "cool. well, now that i saw you do it,",
  "it's crazy how good i am at your job.",
  "when i get back, remind me to tell you",
  "was the only way to get his phone back",
  "come here and give an old friend a hug.",
  "- i can hear you. - ah, look at that time.",
  "i don't know, a year, year and a half.",
  "the gift you bought her, did you buy it",
  "i will do it, so you can count this",
  "so i guess what i'm trying to say is",
  "they were like, what can we do to help?",
  "right? i don't see what the big deal is",
  "i knew it was wrong, and i did nothing,",
  "that if i don't back you up on this,",
  "i get to sleep in a bed by myself.",
  "- can i talk to him? - uh, let me check.",
  "the weird thing is, i love her so much,",
  "if i could pay someone else to do it?",
  "he's the son of a close friend of mine.",
  "and i thought it was a waste of time.",
  "but i guess we'll just have to make do.",
  "the point is, we can help you find him.",
  "so i went out on the roof to practice...",
  "i'm sorry. this is all very new for me.",
  "i cannot figure you out, but i love it.",
  "i just want to know how he did it.",
  "we don't have a lot of time to waste,",
  "and i know you did the best you could.",
  "a man can do anything if he has those.",
  "but it was a lot to live up to.",
  "you seem to be doing all right so far.",
  "i didn't want her to have one from you.",
  "do you know, i don't know what this is?",
  "i just want to ask you a few questions.",
  "you step out of line, you deal with me.",
  "if i can help one of them find peace...",
  "you want to be a hero? is that it?",
  "it's like i was up there just to watch.",
  "you're not going to put me in a prison.",
  "oh, i am so not taking you to dinner.",
  "if i win, you do the road my way.",
  "no, no, no, no! get out of the store!",
  "i liked her a lot.",
  "you asking me out?",
  "if you want me to leave, just say it.",
  "i have no choice.",
  "and then go on, get on with your day?",
  "and for the first time in a long while...",
  "you do not wanna go to the ice box.",
  "i don't care what the kid did to me.",
  "it was my job to stop people like him.",
  "i'm with the old white guy on this one.",
  "as a piece of shit a long time ago.",
  "and you are not giving up on that boy.",
  "and it was the best thing i ever did.",
  "- but i did have to help a kid. - yeah.",
  "i don't have what it takes to do this...",
  "well, i may be super, but i'm no hero.",
  "and you will learn in the worst of ways",
  "i bet you let the kid off easy, too.",
  "i put all my money on you and now...",
  "this is not gonna end well for you, no.",
  "i heard you might be able to point me",
  "i'd go with you, but i don't want to.",
  "i got a plan. you're not gonna like it.",
  "hey, i told you guys to get to bed.",
  "to talk to you about for some time now.",
  "and it's time for you to get out there.",
  "so, what do we got? who's on the list?",
  "i just have a lot of work to do.",
  "you coming out? or am i gonna go in?",
  "the son, also! you got to get the son!",
  "no! it is him, and i will prove it!",
  "i just have a lot going on right now.",
  "but all you gotta do to win it",
  "they rushed you in a chopper. but it took a little while to find you.",
  "you don't know how to use that, do you?",
  "so what have you been up to, buddy boy?",
  "what do you mean, what do we do now?",
  "i am nervous! i'm about to meet my kid",
  "and i don't know what to say to her.",
  "i just wrote him a note, left some food",
  "i think we got off on the wrong foot.",
  "just enough to get a rise out of him.",
  "do you guys have any idea where we are?",
  "do you know how long you have to wait",
  "lam not going to force myself on her.",
  "- i win. - why do you win?",
  "there's a lot of people who don't want to see you finish.",
  "no, not every day.",
  "we got the call to go in, get them out.",
  "- what do you want me to do? - nothing.",
  "give me what i want,",
  "tell him i need a favor.",
  "i was wondering when you were going to call.",
  "to many people, escobar was a hero.",
  "if i don't kill you...",
  "i just want to know where i am.",
  "- sir! sir, take a look at this.",
  "as a matter of fact.",
  "if you know who i am...",
  "i'll take care of anyone in our way.",
  "armed forces pouring into town as part of what we are told",
  "if you want to stay alive, you'll do what i say.",
  "i don't doubt that.",
  "mom, i'm at work. can i call you back?",
  "do women do this to you? or do you...",
  "i think i'll hold on to my free will",
  "when i tell you to come into this room,",
  "- i know you do. - do you want me to leave?",
  "what do we do? the poor thing is lost!",
  "hi. i lost my family. can you help me?",
  "- i thought you told her. - i did tell her!",
  "we got to go. can you take me there?",
  "that's not a bad deal.",
  "happy to see me? i'm happy to see you!",
  "hi. do you know anyone who lost a kid a long time ago that would be me?",
  "you better! if you can't do it in here you'll never do it out in the ocean.",
  "it's what i do best.",
  "i know i've got a problem. i know i'm... and i'm so sorry.",
  "oh! oh, excuse me. can you help us?",
  "i tried to hold on, but i couldn't and i lost her.",
  "- this i've got to see. - yeah, yeah, me too!",
  "okay, we just need to know how we got on,",
  "oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?",
  "-you remember how we met? -i try not to.",
  "and sometimes, if you want to do it four times--",
  "dory, help me find a way out!",
  "this isn't a good idea.",
  "- i got it, i got it, yeah. - he got it.",
  "mr. fish, did you die?",
  "this is gonna be good. i can tell.",
  "which means that he may be on his way here right now.",
  "me. and the next one, just a guess, me.",
  "i am not going to lose you again.",
  "- you can do it! - that's it.",
  "i wish i could, but i don't want to.",
  "so, when do we get to meet her?",
  "why should they meet him?",
  "so you want me to take it back?",
  "how you get any work done is beyond me.",
  "why do you have to break up with her? be a man. just stop calling.",
  "this is a date. you're going on a date.",
  "...but i feel that if i can do this...",
  "i hit her in the eye! in the eye!",
  "come on, she's a person. you can do it.",
  "yes! yes, i did. but what i didn't say....",
  "i would like to get this in one take.",
  "so, what do you think it is about me?",
  "do you know what it's like to grow up...",
  "you know, when i saw you at the store last week...",
  "so at least i'll get to see him again.",
  "...i iove that sound. i must have you now?",
  "but we don't have to go down that road.",
  "...and i could find my way out like that.",
  "now go away so we can talk about you.",
  "- isn't he great? - he's cute. he likes you so much.",
  "you get the pretty one. i get the mess.",
  "look, there's no way for me to tell you this.",
  "oh, i love my life. i love my life.",
  "what's the big deal? just say what you want to do to her.",
  "or what you want her to do to you.",
  "that you like. we get it. you like her. great.",
  "okay, i think i get how to do this.",
  "you have no idea who i am, do you?",
  "oh, it's okay. it was just my left leg.",
  "and now i have a broken foot. i have no monkey and a broken foot!",
  "i'm sorry i was so hard on you before.",
  "give me a call when you get a chance.",
  "...kind of had a little thing on the side.",
  "- well, it does not ring a bell with me. - huh.",
  "this is so fun. all right, what do we do now?",
  "you know, they used to like you a lot.",
  "where is he? he is supposed to be here.",
  "- i got it. - i got it. i'm doing it.",
  "that is it. i want both of you out.",
  "if i see one more cup of coffee....",
  "i can't wait to tell them.",
  "we got a head. we got arms. oh, look at the little fingers.",
  "so i had to do all this other stuff.",
  "i'd be going out with all of you. there'd be pressure",
  "he seems like a very nice guy.",
  "i mean, come on, buddy! get a real car!",
  "and i just know i'm gonna be the one",
  "a week ago, two weeks ago, i was fine.",
  "at least as long as i have the pants.",
  "it's a big deal to me. this is great. i really appreciate this.",
  "i'm guessing he wants to do a little dance...",
  "i promise, i will never take it off my...",
  "how do i tell him that it's too soon?",
  "i am asking you to do me a favor.",
  "and that was so sweet of you to ask.",
  "oh, my god. i'm gonna miss you so much.",
  "i just don't want to see you break up.",
  "well, i was trying to prove that i was right, you know?",
  "my god, i cannot get a minute of peace.",
  "you think i'd just use my son as an excuse?",
  "what kind of father do you think i am?",
  "hey, actually, in a way it's kind of nice. you know?",
  "okay, uh, you know what? we can play a new game.",
  "you should go. why do i have to leave?",
  "now, i want you to have the big, white dog...",
  "chandler, what kind of idiot do you take me for?",
  "it's not a real game. i made it up.",
  "oh, my god. she's going to sit on you.",
  "no, she is not, okay? i'll prove it to you.",
  "- can i talk to you for a second? - sure.",
  "...well, you know, the way that you run is just a little...",
  "do you want me to be afraid of you?",
  "did she just ask me out on a date?",
  "why would you do that to her? why? why?",
  "what'd you guys do to get up on there?",
  "but i'm not sure if we have the time.",
  "it was also funny when i made it up.",
  "and to go from that to this, it's just...",
  "come on, i did it and it was fine.",
  "it wasn't for me, it was for a friend.",
  "did you tell your sister to ask me out?",
  "take good care of that guy. he's a fan.",
  "what's up? oh, my god! what am i doing?!",
  "if we take him to college and come home...",
  "i can't. i keep seeing it the good way.",
  "- here you go. let me ask you a question. - whoops. yeah.",
  "but you got to be with both of them, right?",
  "in fact, i was married to one of them.",
  "i thought i'd bring them to you, you know, in bed.",
  "and to be frank, i thought it would be too. but it's not. i mean, it's not at all.",
  "you sure you want to be seen with me?",
  "do you want our guy to be your guy?",
  "so anyway, how do you want to pay me?",
  "i mean, is it okay if they come visit?",
  "you had no right to go out with him!",
  "- do we do this too much? - i think so.",
  "you know, i know what you mean. i do that, too.",
  "i did not go out with your wife! okay?",
  "and i just put our names down for fun.",
  "hey, hey. i got this one. here you go.",
  "i know, i know. this is all my fault.",
  "okay. a quick one. come on, hug it out.",
  "know what i wanted to be at that age?",
  "-if she says no, can i have the ring? -she won't say no.",
  "i gotta talk to her. i hate this part.",
  "i came here to tell you i still love you.",
  "this is my chance and i won't blow it...",
  "why didn't you tell her it was a plan?",
  "all you know is how to shut people out.",
  "but i did find us a place to sleep.",
  "all right. we got off to a bad start.",
  "aw, look at him trying to kiss my nose.",
  "do you think you could show us the way?",

  "no. i'm in this bed for a reason.",
  "hey, did you know your dad and i...",
  "how about back when it was your plan? when we were gonna use it on tuco.",
  "i mean, how hard could it have been for you to track them down on their turf...",
  "just keep quiet and this won't ever come back to you.",
  "what are you doing? if you need to talk, use the phone.",
  "now, i realise you two have a history...",
  "...was real small. like a bird.",
  "and after a few minutes, i took the gun out of his mouth...",
  "so,i'm going to need you to come with me now.",
  "and then there's two more at the back.",
  "we're gonna need at least five, don't you think?",
  "yeah, no. i don't think this is gonna be... enough.",
  "don't you think if you called, he'd come running?",
  "so have her drive you to the hospital.",
  "by the way, if you're at all worried about working with me...",
  "and how exactly are we gonna do that?",
  "i need to talk to you about something.",
  "he doesn't want to talk about it.",
  "what's to keep him from giving me up? you see?",

  "it's not just about somebody being able to run a lab that big.",
  "- what do you mean? - i mean, him and us, we get it.",
  "...you'll sure as shit wish you were dead.",
  "if you can't get it done with five, you're into spray and pray...",

  "because i would like to speak with him.",
  "it's just- it's so great to see that.",
  "but you gotta tell me one thing...",

  "where do you come up with this number? you pull it from your behind?",
  "oh, yes. you don't think i know who you are?",
  "but he's not man enough to come in here and face me himself.",
  "...will never fill the hole in your heart caused by your tragic loss.",
  "i feel like i need to explain myself.",
  "i didn't want any of this to happen.",
  "i mean, i cannot be alone in feeling this way.",
  "we're in the same boat.",
  "do yourself a favour and learn to take yes for an answer.",
  "yeah, that's cool and all, but i think i got, like, this cat.",
  "think i'm, like, supposed to feed it.",
  "and what the hell was that, anyway?",
  "we need to talk about the car wash.",
  "but you said-- no, i have never used that word.",
  "because we were able to clear the air and, you know--",
  "i had to go to three different bookies.",
  "but you do kind of get used to it.",
  "what do you want? i'm in a meeting.",
  "that is not at all what i meant. i-- we do not do that.",

  "look, i get the logic, l do, but you just went too far with it.",
  "was an ice cream truck.",
  "well, i mean, he found the guy, right?",
  "you don't think it behooves me to be able to explain any of this?",
  "okay, the key thing to remember here is that it's not about any one hand.",
  "you know, we've got a lot of ground to cover.",
  "you tell them the whole story.",
  "let's just pick up where we left off. i'm weak, i'm out of control.",
  "that we can all support each other. and then maybe i'll tear up a little.",
  "come on, guys. it's down the hall here.",

  "how can you know how bad radio frequencies, microwaves,",
  "or jeremy could be the next dead body.",
  "- yep. - don't even wanna take a wild guess?",
  "what, do you expect me to just believe that?",
  "- yeah. sorry. - no, hang on to it, just in case.",
  "...to watch over the money, that means i need, like, a gun, right?",
  "- i think it would be good... - look, i'm starved.",
  "you're not capable of being the guy. i had a guy, but now i don't.",

  "probably don't know who he is.",
  "i've no time to waste.",
  "all i know is when he tells me that your employer took him out...",
  "all i know is it's gonna happen.",
  "just put it down and we'll talk, all right?",

  "we just need to destroy what's on it.",
  "an incendiary device. one quick fire is all it would take.",
  "all right, so you wanna talk money?",
  "what did we say about you coming here?",
  "okay, i think we're good to go.",
  "...it's gonna make one hell of a noise, and there goes your element of surprise.",
  "so she comes to me with a problem.",
  "my people and i are here to help.",
  "and i'm not saying all of them, okay?",
  "...you can tell us who's still out there...",
  "how far did you get down the list?",
  "well, look at this. what are you doing?",
  "- she said she wanted to wait for you. - she does, huh?",
  "- tell me she ate her dinner, at least. - oh, yes, she ate everything.",
  "if you have anything to say to me, now's the time.",

  "- we didn't shake on it. no. - yes. yes.",
  "it's one of the top ten commandments. it's in the ten commandments...",
  "...for you to be afraid of anymore, okay?",

  "he made up his mind ten minutes ago.",
  "this here? this is a whole other story.",
  "if you can find him, we'll kill him.",
  "that might not be too good for us.",
  "we'd take care of the job after that.",

  "thank you for coming. i wasn't sure if you'd get my message.",
  "this is your lead? why are we here?",
  "-excuse me, captain. -i don't want to be disturbed.",
  "that i'm more than just a work friend.",
  "i'm sorry you had to go through that.",
  "no, you were right. this is the best job i've ever had,",
  "so time for me to get out there",
  "do you have any idea what this means?",
  "we'll just be here till you get back.",
  "i just really need it for no reason.",
  "i don't know how to make you cool.",
  "i just wanna be part of a conversation",
  "i didn't even make it past one person.",
  "i wasn't a crazy idiot, and i won!",
  "i had a feeling you might say that, thusfore,",
  "i still have two hours to find fingers and get holt's watch back.",
  "if you'll excuse me, sir, i have to,",
  "then i suggest you think of this moment as the montage",
  "look at the view from up here.",
  "i was going to try and steal your watch?",
  "and he would do anything to help you.",
  "no, in fact, i had them wash it.",
  "and i'm gonna find out who did it.",
  "now let's go look for some bad kids",
  "just talk to her like a normal person.",
  "my middle name is more important to you",
  "and, of course, you would be most upset",
  "there might be some left in my mouth",
  "that girl over there sold it to me.",
  "but then, when i asked her about it,",
  "she didn't even try to shake his hand.",
  "you sure you wanna go with that one?",
  "thank you so much for coming out today.",
  "i'd say she's in line at the bank.",
  "it's like you're going out of your way",
  "and he has no idea about the new",
  "i just forget stuff like a cool person.",
  "but i want to be captain one day,",
  "you know, i actually heard about a guy",
  "here's the stuff you left at my place.",

  "i'm gonna hit her with one of these.",
  "and that's how i get in her head.",
  "hey, guys, let's take it easy on him.",
  "why, what did i say? you know what?",
  "so i thought we could head over there",
  "i gave the hotel room to my father",

  "i'd like to remind you of what happened",
  "i know you're all leaving in an hour,",
  "i want to work in the break room,",
  "we don't know yet, sir, but we are...",
  "we want people to be happy and calm.",

  "what's going on? you have to tell me.",
  "tell him to turn around and go home.",
  "i don't want to say the wrong thing",
  "and hurt him more than i have to.",

  "they want us on the next flight out,",
  "even so, how do we get in there?",
  "i told you that was not gonna work.",

  "the point is, it will not happen again.",
  "which is not as dirty as it sounds.",
  "oh, i wish i could be that free.",
  "okay, this is everyone i could think of",
  "who would want to mess with my life.",
  "time you could have spent on my case,",
  "i can't believe i'm about to say this.",
  "great, let's just go out to your desk",
  "but first, i want to ask the captain",
  "sure, but what do they want from him?",
  "he likes me because i got him off",
  "well, someone said it to me last night.",
  "you still have time to make it right.",
  "first of all, the doctor was a woman.",
  "and he said that i was perfectly fine,",
  "i promise i won't go into the field",
  "you can work the case from right here,",
  "does it look like i'm on the job?",
  "all right. it was a lie. i'm sorry.",
  "i had to make it sound really cool",
  "we only have to make small talk for...",
  "why are you looking at me like that?",
  "i mean, we can really get into it.",
  "the fact that you would sell me out",
  "well, no one asked you to do that.",
  "that you came all the way down here",
  "and i think i'm a little bit late.",
  "how do you take care of those things?",
  "i bought this room. i deserve this ice.",
  "but how? we didn't know each other yet.",
  "but if you don't give yourself a break,",
  "hey, i just wanted to say i'm sorry",
  "also, i fear any other decision i make",
  "well, well, well, what do we have here?",
  "i don't give a crap about the food.",
  "look, i have another kid on the way.",
  "you should have told him to back off.",
  "okay, i know what you two are doing.",
  "i was gonna have a cup of coffee",
  "so that i could stay up and... kiss.",
  "that just has an old man out front?",
  "you know, still a long way to go.",
  "but no, she has not done that yet.",
  "you left your cell phone on your desk,",
  "well, i thought we were getting a drink",
  "sorry, guys. i got this in the bag.",
  "no! no, no, no. it was a mistake.",
  "and now one of them shows up dead.",
  "guys, i really need this to go well.",
  "i asked my wife and she said no.",
  "she wants to see us in her office,",
  "no, no, no. we can't let that happen.",
  "she took one look at me and said,",
  "oh, i can't wait to read that book.",
  "come out with your hands on your head.",
  "all right, i'm gonna go talk to him.",
  "all right, we got to get there quick.",
  "and it always had a table for me.",
  "is so it wouldn't be weird at work.",
  "not that i've ever had a bad one.",
  "- unless... - no, i don't want to do that.",
  "- you have to. - i'm not gonna do it.",
  "and this is where our first date was.",
  "i mean, it's what got us in here.",
  "all i can say is i know you,",
  "and i know you'll have a good time.",
  "so clearly you don't know me at all.",
  "it's gonna be a hell of a ride.",
  "i'm sure you'd like to take some weight",
  "so here's how i see this going down.",
  "- what the hell? - why are you doing this?",
  "they're trying to come up with a name",
  "hey, people like the way that i look.",
  "but now i can see you're super serious",
  "because of how well i would handle it.",
  "if we want to break rules, break rules.",
  "i just said no because of the rules.",
  "- the guy is dead. - it's not a game.",
  "he is the worst captain we've ever had.",
  "we got off on the wrong foot here.",
  "no, you either love them, or you don't.",
  "because i get to take credit for it.",
  "- but we thought... - i can't save your ass.",
  "i like the way your butt looks today.",
  "i want to live in this moment forever.",
  "really, tell that to me in an hour",
  "maybe you should just call it a day.",
  "- one drink, and then we go. - one drink.",
  "so listen, remember when you said to me",
  "yeah, i know. we just need two minutes.",
  "do you really need to warm up, though?",
  "i wanted to give you the biggest hug.",
  "but we just need a minute to think.",
  "ah, a message of hope, right on time.",
  "it was long enough for me to know",
  "sir, i don't know how to thank you.",
  "so you think i should look for someone",
  "how do you keep them off the bed?",
  "for weeks, but i can never prove it.",
  "did you see them take your ice cream?",
  "when she's done, i'm gonna ask her out.",
  "and i don't want to be too forward...",
  "they just gave me ten years in prison.",
  "all i'm saying as a... if not the...",
  "that might be trying to set you up?",
  "i've got to hand it to you, buddy",
  "oh, and you think she's gonna want to",
  "but i didn't eat it; i couldn't have.",
  "i think a problem the police have had",
  "we want to make it up to you.",
  "of time here, so what do you say",
  "it'll be so... i can't even fake it.",
  "look, i don't know when i'll be home.",
  "yeah, how cool... i mean awful... is that?",
  "now, get the hell out of my office.",
  "i could get you to talk to him.",
  "and when i put my mind to something,",
  "but it's how we back up that matters.",
  "and you found him all on your own.",
  "keep it just for myself as a secret.",
  "i am not! you know who i am!",
  "and last year, i let the captain win,",
  "i'm not going to meet my next boyfriend",
  "is if we took a picture right here,",
  "matter of fact, what if we did one",
  "it was the worst thing in the world...",
  "will you excuse me for just one moment?",
  "here i am with the power to decide",
  "forget it. run as fast as you can!",
  "he left a tiny crack in the blind,",
  "yeah, i'm not an idiot. i know how",
  "you know what i do with that time?",
  "all he does is talk about his wife",
  "we're gonna do it my way, all right?",
  "this is going to be fun as hell.",
  "we had three dogs die in the well.",
  "no, i think he may have a point.",
  "it'll be okay, guys. no need to worry.",
  "i know. it's a pretty big hole, right?",
  "come on, bring it in. bring it in.",
  "what if i never get a second chance?",
  "i went home from your place to shower,",
  "this is who you want to be with?",
  "oh, i didn't realize that was your car.",
  "he said he'll point him out to us.",
  "can i talk to you for a minute?",
  "how much to take this bad boy home?",
  "so i can put it wherever i want.",
  "i can see the feed better from here.",
  "boom... used the thing you said to me",
  "which, now that i say it out loud,",
  "and we would often talk about his work.",
  "and i will now speak in a low,",
  "all right, i'm gonna go check this out.",
  "does anyone know how to turn it off?",
  "you think we should pretend to be dead?",
  "just tell him what he wants to hear.",
  "hey, what took so long? is she okay?",
  "and i never want to see your daughter",
  "for once in your life, don't ruin it.",
  "perhaps you don't have a word for it?",
  "but i have a friend who i think",
  "what can i do to help? i'm sorry,",
  "he will not stop trying to friend me.",
  "no, but we think we figured out how",
  "how did you not pick up on that?",
  "but the important thing is, we had fun.",
  "- to have worked with you. - yeah, i know.",
  "and i thought of what you should do",
  "- when we get to the store. - on it.",
  "- please, tell me more. - okay. i got it.",
  "there better be a gun to your head.",
  "and we're looking for a place to hide.",
  "- i told you to watch her! - i know.",
  "no, no, no. that is a bad idea.",
  "and wait for me to come rescue him.",
  "give that back to me. are you serious?",
  "okay, you took it a little too far.",
  "big time! we're trying to have a baby!",
  "tell him what the hard way is, boss.",
  "can i talk to you for a second?",
  "now, come on; let's get back in there",
  "she can't do that. can she do that?",
  "i mean, i couldn't get rid of her.",
  "oh, as if you don't know it's perfect.",
  "it's obvious why the guy wants to talk",
  "as soon as she comes back in here,",
  "how are you always in charge of that?",
  "well, okay, i don't want to tell you",
  "we were never going to ask you to.",
  "that guy kind of looks like my dad.",
  "it's a cold case from my first year",
  "that's why i never work any of it.",
  "we were only in contact with that guy",
  "sir, i'd be happy to keep you company.",
  "i'm sorry, did you not hear me say",
  "yes, we heard you, dr. bad news doctor.",
  "every time we check one off the list,",
  "no, i just got very cold very fast.",
  "well, it's like my dad used to say.",
  "what the hell is going on in here?",
  "that i could be happy one day too.",
  "all we wanted to do was help you",
  "but i think it's gonna work itself out.",
  "or as they like to say at sea...",
  "what, did she laugh out loud one time?",
  "we're the only two people to see it.",
  "listen, as long as he's on my boat,",
  "i never thought we'd see one in person.",
  "no! no, no way. i'm not buying it.",
  "'cause i'm gonna be here for six weeks.",
  "you should be glad she has her own.",
  "can't we just lock him up in there?",
  "i just can't do that if you're dead.",
  "and now you're here, and i love you,",
  "but you know what? no. no, no, no.",
  "this is a little song i wrote myself,",
  "i got him. follow me. ah, come on.",
  "he has to be somewhere on this boat.",
  "thank you. it means a lot to me.",
  "but you don't know her like i do.",
  "and he says they're all in the past.",
  "did you wear this hat in high school?",
  "you got to turn it, like, four times",
  "got married and moved in with his wife.",
  "you know what i see? a naked hero.",
  "should we do it again next week, sir?",
  "and i just want this to end now.",
  "no wait. boys to man back to boys.",
  "- sir, we have a problem. - yeah, we do.",
  "hey, you know what else is too tight?",
  "and when i had nothing else to give,",
  "we got to go in fast and strong.",
  "and, yes, i forgot you that one time,",
  "son of a bitch! i hope there's room",
  "hope your dog will help with neck pain.",
  "sir, i had nothing to do with this.",
  "and, yes, sometimes you have to come up",
  "- hey, you don't get to sing. - shut up!",
  "you know that i'm your guy for this.",
  "but i know what you're really made of.",
  "the two of you might be better off",
  "i got the cheese out, by the way.",
  "so how do you like our plan now?",
  "i admit that there's not as much money",
  "oh, man, look at him. this is bad.",
  "oh, yeah. you want to sit with us.",
  "told you i knew what i was doing.",
  "no, no, ow! that was a gun, man!",
  "we're gonna get the rest of these guys.",
  "and i think we've all grown as women.",
  "okay, but i'll have you know right now",
  "two ways to pop in on a friend.",
  "great. now, i've got to get some sleep.",
  "oh, well, i don't know if you noticed,",
  "and that is a job i take seriously.",
  "but i need you to work with me.",
  "all right, i got to keep following him.",
  "why wouldn't i call it? i'm doing this.",
  "i know you have a gun on me.",
  "why didn't you tell us about her?",
  "i didn't belong there.",
  "go sleep in your soft bed, over.",
  "that's the way, cliff. watch him close.",
  "let's take a look at the next category!",
  "boy, you sure know how to pick 'em!",
  "could use a moment alone with my daughter.",
  "for today is the day i forever change.",
  "that it only takes one minute to pack?",
  "i'm so in. this is gonna be fantastic.",
  "how about i just leave you two alone?",
  "- i need you to sign this report. - okay.",
  "so i can do this all over again.",
  "- oh, you noticed it? - yeah, i noticed it!",
  "no, i don't want to sleep with you.",
  "i'm sorry, but you'd only slow us down.",
  "so that'll buy us at least an hour.",
  "i'll need three teeth from both of you.",
  "all right, we can take it from there.",
  "this is what you told me to do!",
  "how about we just get a drink first?",
  "will you please just get in the car?",
  "oh, my, oh! you really are acting out!",
  "he will say yes to anything right now.",
  "oh, yes, i will stay at your home.",
  "take care of this for me, will you?",
  "and ends up giving you what you want.",
  "he has to be our guy. let's go.",
  "okay, i give up. i need your help.",
  "next time don't be so weird about it.",
  "oh, no, i thought he might have gotten",
  "my wife says i cannot have red meat,",
  "cool, the low point of my entire life.",
  "so not only have i been through hell,",
  "ah, so not reading into it at all.",
  "i'm not sure if it's his favorite movie",
  "i get it, but you're just saying that",
  "and this whole thing is gonna blow up.",
  "hey, man! what the hell were you doing?",
  "- i can't believe i was wrong. - i can.",
  "and you know who else we also love?",
  "some of us even love her so much",
  "thank you guys so much for this party.",
  "i mean, a man's life is in danger.",
  "as much as i'd like to see that,",
  "hang on, we don't know that for sure.",
  "i don't know. i haven't met the guy.",
  "all right, now all you need to do",
  "ah, how did i not see this coming?",
  "is the best part of the whole night.",
  "is that it? did he say anything else?",
  "yeah, she should be the first one here.",
  "we share a life. i tell her everything.",
  "i don't know. is anyone gonna buy it?",
  "i don't know if i believe in god,",
  "we need to work on your tough talk.",
  "we're gonna get her to come to you.",
  "i mean, i know how hard it is",
  "so i can get anything for a price.",
  "is for you to back the hell off...",
  "i know, and if i back down now",
  "i know, but it wasn't a good time.",
  "you have to just trust me on this.",
  "i trust her to stay out of danger,",
  "that's not tough enough to be in here.",
  "it's harder than i thought it would be.",
  "but i wasn't letting you do your job.",
  "- can i get in there? - no! he's mine.",
  "no, i lost the key to her apartment,",
  "no, we're not tight. i barely know him.",
  "i don't know, but, just to be safe,",
  "- we both know why i'm here. - we do?",
  "whoa, wait. hold on. stop. both of you.",
  "thanks. i know just where to put that.",
  "and then head home and get some sleep.",
  "no! i do want to hear about them.",
  "it's like, help me out a little bit.",
  "what? we have to get on that plane.",
  "i don't care what you have to do...",
  "wait a minute. i know what's going on.",
  "i'm on the roof. he's on the roof!",
  "one more step, and i kill your captain.",
  "i've said i love you to him before,",
  "and he never gets to meet my baby?",
  "oh, my god, you're right. we did it.",
  "what are you gonna tell your kids, man?",
  "what the hell is going on with you?",
  "how will i know to open the door?",
  "you know what they gave me for it?",
  "any respect, i might as well get paid.",
  "i asked the guy, why you so fly?",
  "because i knew you were on the case.",
  "i can't hear you. can you hear me?",
  "what did you say? we can't hear you.",
  "but we were told not to get involved.",
  "the type of guy that just got off",
  "all right, dude. keep it in your pants.",
  "sir, can i speak with you over here?",
  "can i take this for a test drive?",
  "that's all you have to say to me?",
  "since i'm here, why don't i grab, like,",
  "i just want you guys to be happy.",
  "- and i will help you with that. - great!",
  "oh, come on, for running a stop sign?",
  "what do we got going on back there?",
  "the point is, neither of us are lying.",
  "or how do you want to do this?",
  "we have the right to a phone call.",
  "i got to keep my heart rate up.",
  "so he's just staying out of our way.",
  "i don't know, maybe he's not buying it.",
  "you have the most important job of all.",
  "but that's not what i came here for.",
  "but you can open it when it's closed.",
  "a man i had put my trust in,",
  "i don't want them to rescue me again.",
  "i need to clean up my own mess.",
  "i kinda feel like this is my fault.",
  "okay, i guess i'll go in for, uh,",
  "we can't spend five of it on this.",
  "oh, god, what if it doesn't go well?",
  "we haven't seen each other in a while,",
  "as long as possible, but you know me...",
  "i asked you if you had to go.",
  "i don't think it's safe to stay here.",
  "quick follow-up: did you ever look up at the moon",
  "do you not do that for your kids?",
  "look, i know this isn't the right time",
  "you want to know if there was tongue.",
  "it's clearly a name he just made up.",
  "and then we're gonna sort this all out.",
  "then i'm gonna drive to a gas station",
  "so i know this is weird to say,",
  "- it was fine. - a lot of college girls.",
  "you know who else is up right now?",
  "and i can't do that without my partner.",
  "you really think you can lie to me?",
  "- was that a lie? - i don't know, maybe.",
  "but that is not all he picked up.",
  "well, we have got ourselves a case and",
  "- come on, tell me. - not talking about it.",
  "- oh, is that not allowed? - it is not.",
  "i'm a nice guy... i'm in the right.",
  "just trying to turn up, as it were.",
  "why is no one having a good time?",
  "well, well, well, if it isn't one of",
  "that your best friend now has a son.",
  "- i don't want to get... - okay, got it.",
  "you can just leave me out this year.",
  "then i'm sure you won't mind me asking",
  "stop. i know you already have a plan.",
  "so much more fun to make you watch.",
  "we got to stop playing by the rules",
  "i bet you're wondering why i did it.",
  "it's actually not as bad as it sounds.",
  "no! no, no, no. that's a bad idea.",
  "- what are you doing? - i'm trying to make",
  "but you told me to put it down.",
  "forget it. the thing i wanna say is,",
  "don't you dare try to cut me out.",
  "i was my own sign the whole time?",
  "glad i took you along for the ride.",
  "we've never even been on a real date,",
  "- yeah? - oh, i just wanted to thank you",
  "i'm just very busy. get back to work.",
  "- i'd like to share. - oh, my god, sir,",
  "what do you mean you knew that already?",
  "this... this i could get on board for.",
  "he's got a point. i like this guy.",
  "oh, uh, you know, if they have it,",
  "oh, i didn't. i brought it with me",
  "you know what? you won't be able to",
  "hey, you can run, but you can't hide.",
  "so, uh, what are you doing out here?",
  "i think you might be on to something.",
  "we should go talk to them right now.",
  "why is he looking at me like that?",
  "so what was that? you set me up?",
  "i guess you must have missed that fact",

  "you're not a father. you never will be.",
  "all right, i think i'm good on this.",
  "yeah, been staring at it for an hour.",
  "i'm gonna pretend none of that was said",
  "or no, you didn't get it on tape?",

  "i remember when i was a little boy,",
  "what y'all call it? y'all call it four?",
  "you think he'll let me shoot his gun?",

  "i know, but i had thought of it",
  "you never told me what it was for.",
  "damn it! so this is how it ends.",
  "do you want a coffee while you wait?",

  "oh, what? i thought i was pretty good.",
  "if they have that much money on them,",
  "i don't wanna put them down, you know?",
  "i told you, you can't be back here.",

  "why are you doing that with your face?",
  "and this is the last thing i need!",
  "keep your hands where i can see 'em.",
  "has ever happened to me, and i've done",
  "can throw at us that we can't handle.",
  "it's about a guy that looks like you.",
  "okay. so why don't you back me up?",
  "are we gonna get in trouble like daddy?",
  "then i don't want to be a woman.",
  "if that's who you are... you know what?",
  "and tried to get your daddy in trouble,",

  "i can quite believe i'm gonna say this,",
  "but you can still be on the board.",
  "this is... this is what i wanted to show you.",
  "not this one. it's always been her plan",
  "but i think the worst is behind us.",
  "so you're gonna have to pay for it.",
  "it really does smell bad. my eyes hurt.",
  "first we gotta figure out where she is.",
  "i'm just trying to build a fun world.",
  "took me all morning to get it together!",
  "oh, i thought you were telling me off.",
  "i can call them, and they'll tell me",
  "well, next time, do the city a favor",
  "and we have no idea where she is.",
  "and say she came here for a record.",
  "do you have guys have any video games?",
  "no, they look exactly the same to me.",
  "it was an accident, she didn't mean it.",
  "i'm sorry it had to end this way.",
  "i'll wait three years for the next one.",
  "i just set up a video game system.",
  "okay. well, i just wanted to show you",
  "what the hell is taking you so long?",
  "leave me! i know it's gonna be hard",
  "ah, when we went to that water park,",
  "- i've been going at him for six hours.",
  "'cause i'm about to put on a show.",
  "- and you want me to cover the case",
  "hey, this is fun. let's do it again.",
  "- no, no, no, i'll be good. i'll leave.",
  "is there anyone who knew you'd be out?",
  "- oh, of course it is. i love it.",
  "oh, boy, what did i get myself into?",
  "- i'll get the car. stay with my mother.",
  "- great. so you want to call your mother?",
  "look, i don't talk about this a lot,",
  "you were listening to me. - not at all.",
  "- oh, no, i had a bunch of practice.",
  "'cause i told her i never drink water",
  "yes, it's all no one is talking about.",
  "but we figured we'd find him for you,",
  "and, who knows, if you find the guy,",
  "or maybe one of us could fill it.",
  "unless one of us wanted to back off",
  "so we could see what this guy knows.",
  "- i don't know how to reach him. - okay.",
  "- oh, well, i... - tell me where he is.",
  "- what was it called again? - i don't know.",
  "why do we have to do it together?",
  "- come on! - what are you two up to?",
  "it's too loud! we can all hear it!",
  "okay, but the second that we find him...",
  "yeah, totally. i'll do that to you too,",
  "i mean, he could have opened the door",
  "no way. this guy is not that smart.",
  "no, we thought we'd leave that to you.",
  "yeah, but you brought him in. you won.",
  "- i think you won. - i say you won.",
  "so i tell you what i'm gonna do.",
  "and as a man, i'd like to apologize",
  "- okay. - come on, i'll buy you a drink",
  "god, why is this so hard for me?",
  "- we all love him. - what do you want?",
  "okay, i should be back in an hour.",
  "i'd feel so much better about my self",
  "- am i right? - well, my guess is that",
  "easy. you just take one of their guys",

  "and you still have no fear of me.",
  "that there was a camera in the room.",
  "plus, i mean, i can teach you guys",
  "oh, nope. i didn't do it that time.",
  "why did you make all that stuff up?",
  "oh, my god, i already thought of that,",
  "you know, when i first met you two,",
  "plus, i should go home, take a shower,",
  "for all of us that crime doesn't pay.",
  "you are not gonna get away with this.",
  "they make me sick! i'm the sick one!",
  "you need to get your crap in order.",
  "so maybe we can talk about this later?",
  "what are they gonna find in one day?",
  "and only i know where to find him.",
  "for the bank where the money showed up.",
  "i think i figured out where he is.",
  "where he goes when he's on the run.",
  "so i had to bring in a friend.",

  "i don't care. i barely speak to them.",
  "oh, come on! focus on the case, man.",
  "can you state your name for the record?",
  "there you are, you son of a bitch.",
  "we might have to make a quick stop.",
  "he does miss you when you're not here.",
  "sam: so let's say we agree to this thing.",
  "if we have one hand on the wheel,",
  "to kiss her ass a few years ago?",
  "to come up and say a few words.",
  "what are we giving up to do it?",
  "you mean when i was doing my job.",
  "she tell you to stay out of it?",
  "and you have plenty of reason to be.",
  "they can't help but be afraid of you.",
  "i used to think of myself one way.",
  "i'm trying to... what do you call it?",
  "yet, dad was a pain in the ass,",
  "but he and mom always made it work.",
  "you fear that if you open your mouth,",
  "you really think he'd be on our side?",
  "- can i have five minutes with him? - sure.",
  "no! if she knew, she would freak out.",
  "oh, my god, what are you doing here?",
  "you know, he kinda tried to kill me.",
  "sorry. i'll put it on the list, too.",
  "it was time to get off my ass.",
  "had to put a little coffee in him...",
  "look, i really don't want to hurt you.",
  "guys, look, i'd love to keep this up,",
  "but i've only got one job here today...",

  "the last one going to a holding company",
  "am i supposed to know who that is?",
  "it's not exactly the word i would use.",
  "believe it or not, it's kind of hard",
  "it's a good way not to die, though.",
  "i may not be the man i was",
  "everyone we know is trying to kill us.",
  "if you guys eat that sort of thing.",
  "you and i are gonna take a ride.",
  "a whole lot of people are gonna die.",
  "how many paid the price before you did?",
  "i don't think he's the kind you save.",
  "i don't know if i can do that.",

  "i wouldn't do that, if i were you.",
  "did i say this was a love story?",
  "i think we owe him that one, yeah?",
  "and we all know how this turned out.",
  "and i think she's in love with me.",
  "so, yeah, today was about as much fun",
  "i bet it feels huge in this hand.",
  "so, the doctor says, the bad news is",
  "uh, i saw her head to the back.",
  "now, i may not feel, but he does.",
  "i did not tell him to do that.",
  "leave a message and have a happy day.",
  "oh, my god, i haven't seen you since...",
  "then maybe i wasn't meant to wear 'em.",
  "about to stand in front of a girl...",
  "what the fuck am i gonna tell her?",
  "that was not mean. i'm proud of you!",
  "well, we don't have that kind of money.",

  "yeah, i can't believe it. it's so cool!",
  "are you sure we should be doing this?",
  "you mean i pretend i have a mom?",

  "- look, they're in love. - oh, no, no, no.",
  "and i'm telling you, this is the guy.",
  "in his eyes, and i don't like it!",
  "but, on the less crazy side of things,",
  "you know, tear it up, see what happens!",
  "i mean, no, he didn't just tell me.",
  "i think i'm good with just the one.",
  "oh, and, uh, just between you and me?",
  "so, i take it the date went well?",

  "ma, someday i'm going to go to the moon.",
  "we've been working on this for a while.",
  "and you had better be in this car!",
  "you've gotta let us play for it!",
  "now, the rest of the plan is simple.",
  "i told you not to touch my things.",
  "just don't come out of that room again!",
  "i know how much you like to laugh",
  "- are we on tv? - what are those? children?",
  "you've been at this for far too long with far too little success.",
  "so how will we get to the moon?",
  "oh, is that right? back at your place? that's cool.",
  "it is still no, so go to sleep.",
  "you use them when you tell the story.",
  "three little kittens loved to play, they had fun in the sun all day.",
  "i was thinking that maybe we could move the date of the heist.",
  "can we just wait a few more minutes?",
  "when i get in there, you are in for a world of pain!",
  "i just came up with it now, actually.",
  "and i will never let you go again.",
  "tonight we are going to read a new book.",

  "i... i'm trying to find my own way back.",
  "we are made of matter, and nothing more.",
  "you think you know how the world works?",
  "but... even if my fingers could do that,",
  "how do i get from here to there?",
  "uh, you know, people used to think that i was funny.",
  "look beyond the world in front of you.",
  "oh come on, just give me the book, huh?",
  "- sir, we need to... - where is she?",
  "- she is not who you think she is. - you don't have the right to say that.",
  "you have no idea of what he truly is.",
  "- do you wonder what i see in your future? - no.",
  "so, i could have my hands back again?",
  "so, what can i do for you? man!",
  "you should see the look on your face.",
  "i like what you've done with the place.",
  "well, i don't see what choice you have.",
  "you either go home and face the music",
  "you gave him his space. kids love that.",
  "so, did you, uh, ever have the baby?",
  "oh, i have so many questions for you.",
  "are you sure you don't wanna come, dad?",
  "i thought it had to be four numbers.",

  "but now, from the bottom of my heart,",
  "does ten sound like a lot to you?",
  "what does sound like a lot to you?",

  "how come they never call me fun mom?",
  "i'll remind you kids what real fun is.",
  "this is my thing and always will be.",
  "we get the family dressed up to go",

  "you know, i can hear everything you say",
  "i don't want you to make a sound.",
  "we will not. now if you don't mind,",
  "why do you say future? this is now.",

  "but this place is always a crime scene.",
  "he took the kids to see his dad.",
  "the one thing you were good at, and...",
  "and put the other one in that bag?",
  "never putting me next to a pretty girl.",
  "but i do speak for the common man",
  "i'm going to say you are my father.",
  "the great thing is, when they get in,",
  "i mean, sure, we all love his music...",
  "i love that guy. we listen to it.",
  "and that, kids, is how you stick it",
  "the only way i would be your friend",
  "it didn't hurt that his daddy was dumb.",
  "or i could kill them all right now!",
  "even as her husband went off to fight",
  "but in the end, they're still a family.",
  "yes, i did. now i'm going to bed.",
  "can you throw me my house key? please!",
  "and when i came back to get it,",
  "what was it we trying to prove again?",
  "why does the guy have to do everything",
  "no excuse, i just forgot all about you.",
  "it's kind of a long trip down there.",
  "wait, how long is this love for again?",
  "of lying to girls, for a little while.",
  "and a special thanks for the hard work",
  "and now for the reason we are here.",
  "i don't think this place is so great.",
  "i'm trying to make the best of things,",
  "and how every street is a dead end.",
  "but i'm least as smart as a cat.",
  "we've found a new place that we love,",
  "i'm going to go back to my home.",
  "and give her a piece of my mind!",
  "the only thing that's real, is the sign",
  "i'm doing the best with what i got.",
  "oh, i did the right thing for nothing!",
  "uh, uh, that was just the fire alarm.",
  "uh, yes. in fact, i just used it",
  "yes, yes. you see, it's the only way",
  "not me, when i hit the dance floor.",
  "at last we'll get to the bottom of...",
  "you got home hours late with no fish.",
  "and you and i were going to study",
  "it's no fun to live in a town",
  "son of a...! why did you do that?",
  "come on, boy! we've got to go home!",
  "wow. you told me what's best for me...",
  "...i want to find out who i am...",
  "sorry, kid, but there comes a day when",
  "who could stay married to such a man?",
  "not even close to getting sick of it.",
  "took her years to get the whole set.",
  "where the only rule is always have fun!",
  "i take back everything i said to you",
  "i know my son did a terrible thing.",
  "after this, i'll be lucky to get work",
  "how boring the rest of your life is.",
  "my feet hurt, and my neck is cold.",
  "my wife doesn't want to be with me.",
  "my dear, did you just fall from heaven?",
  "okay, it matters a little what you say.",
  "but it turned out to be big talk.",
  "and why did she call you her love?",
  "how can a fat man hide so well?",
  "this man is totally the son of god.",
  "why did you get to throw a party",
  "and leave the cup on the desk. ha!",
  "we haven't taken in one car all day.",
  "now just when do i get a say",
  "yesterday i gave in to the one thing",
  "and i'll say it in front of god",
  "they'll go easier on you if you do.",
  "she just found out no one likes her.",
  "that's it, i am off of this stuff.",
  "i think this is the end of me.",
  "i try not to cry till you're asleep.",
  "i think i might have a chance to...",
  "we should go to your house and talk.",
  "in front of their eyes and not cry,",
  "which means, i've got a train to catch.",
  "i know where my sister run off to.",
  "all the way here just to see me?",
  "- ow! what was that?! - is that your father?",
  "so, what did you do with your dad?",
  "would you care to hear it in song?",
  "oh, no! i got to take it away",
  "the black hole is looking a lot bigger.",
  "you saw that i had the money, right?",
  "i like it when you don't say words.",
  "might be a hell of a lot better!",
  "i love my life, i love it not.",
  "he'd only take six months to do things.",
  "the hole has been filled by the stuff!",
  "all right! i remember we all got in.",
  "whatever it is, she's in over her head.",
  "i thought the whole point of this trip",
  "i just didn't know how to tell you.",
  "oh, you did that to help me out.",
  "i finally got a chair by the window.",
  "you want me to help you escape? no!",
  "and now there's no amount of ice cream",
  "now stay down here and i'll be back",
  "and every six hours with food for you.",
  "all right, you can go in my mouth.",
  "give it to me! i can imagine it.",
  "it's a long fly ball, going back! back!",
  "sorry, i'm afraid the most i can do",
  "somebody up there is trying to tell you",
  "it's not just inside the house of god,",
  "who knew i needed hope most of all.",
  "but i just got this three months ago.",
  "yeah, that's the kind of thing i do,",
  "oh, you can go ahead and feed her.",
  "i have a plan to deal with that.",
  "i guess i do feel a little bad",
  "i mean, what's wrong with the old ways?",
  "your father lost a lot in his life--",
  "i want you and your husband to know",
  "we were giving away his dog for good.",
  "when i finally got back to the house...",
  "well, i'm afraid i already told my dogs",
  "okay, but i'm a little out of practice.",
  "come on, boy, time to go to bed.",
  "i don't know. feed it to the dog?",
  "can i keep an eye on that kid?",
  "it's time to get back on the horse.",
  "son, the best way to explain this is",
  "well, that is a big part of it.",
  "in other news, we're about to go live",
  "to show you that there's no way out.",
  "i'm not sure we can even live apart.",
  "perhaps you'd like to kill her as well.",
  "now, to sleep the sleep of the just.",
  "i bought you time, boy. don't blow it.",
  "no one in this town has any money.",
  "i think it's time to go off family.",
  "you know what else would be an honor?",
  "maybe we should just give up for now,",
  "oh, uh, well, he wanted to be here,",
  "they can certainly do it for a weekend.",
  "that's why they took our kids so quick.",
  "and then i ran right home to you.",
  "don't you want our baby to be happy?",
  "it's hard to pick just one of those.",
  "i guess it's just me and the dog.",
  "but your mother wouldn't let me do it.",
  "but i'm the main guy in this story.",
  "things are supposed to work out for me.",
  "we can do without tv for a day.",
  "i don't know, kid. i didn't write this.",
  "let's see how far we can take this.",
  "time to teach you to be a man.",
  "when there's so much great stuff on tv.",
  "we know the truth, and we love you.",
  "just like you and me. swear to god.",
  "i got one just for watching the game.",

  "i didn't go to movies as a kid.",
  "of this final horrible part of my life.",
  "i'm sorry, did my voice go all evil?",
  "we put two of those guys up there",
  "could go to your brain and kill you.",
  "i was gonna be one of those guys",
  "and there's a sign in front of it!",
  "i wish i had something to look at.",

  "oh, it's not that hard. just tell them",
  "oh, my god! it's worse than i thought!",
  "that our company is in any way evil.",
  "so much like mine can be all bad.",
  "and i might just have a secret weapon.",
  "where has that word been all my life?",
  "if there's one thing he did not have",
  "can i be honest with you? they're not.",
  "my mom can't afford to buy me clothes,",
  "i said beat it! for the time being.",
  "i don't know. i feel naked without it.",
  "oh, i'd love to, but, uh, i'm sure",
  "i need to look at the pictures again.",
  "oh, well, i guess we have to go",
  "and never knew how much it was worth.",
  "anybody want to give me a ride home?",
  "you're not gonna let it go, are you?",
  "and nothing can stop me from selling it",
  "if there's one thing art is good for,",
  "to make them tell us who they respect--",
  "then you can be a hero like me.",
  "i don't eat as much as i did!",
  "when did you come up with the idea?",

  "when you said i felt stuck with you.",
  "well, i sold it and bought this dress.",
  "dad, i believe we were on a date?",
  "no. i'm throwing you out of the house.",
  "time for you to go to your mother's.",
  "i'm sure you're one of the good ones.",
  "i don't think i'm ready for this, man.",
  "oh, my god. we went home with you?",
  "once and for all, what is the secret?",
  "why did you stay with dad so long?",
  "you will take art, you will enjoy art,",
  "i need your boy to make a baby.",
  "a good time for you to find out",
  "what kind of a monster could do that?",

  "we should get this show on the road.",
  "of what i thought was my last meal.",
  "and i guess i don't have any friends.",
  "go! i'll take care of him!",
  "i guess i'm just really bad at this.",
  "of people who died with the tv on.",
  "so this is what a body looks like",
  "i'm not gonna lie to you, for funny,",
  "oh... i guess there's nothing left to do",
  "i'm in charge. you do what i say.",
  "and old guys who can't sleep at night",
  "because of what they did in the war.",
  "but we've only been at sea one day.",
  "so he can and will order you around.",
  "as you can see, i was just two",
  "okay, so i don't want to do anything",
  "well, then why do you want this job?",
  "but thanks for talking it out with me.",
  "i'm going to have to let you go.",
  "why does this have to be so hard?!",
  "but we'll get through this as a family.",

  "wait! stop! why must you kill my dad?",
  "i'm dying to know how you got here.",
  "oh, so we can kill that person instead.",
  "we just have to kill all your children.",
  "would be more full of peace and love.",
  "it looks like it's just you and me.",
  "i want that. well, you can't have it.",
  "but we'd have to round them up first.",
  "how are you gonna get to the future?",
  "why are you wearing your hat at dinner?",
  "and i want you to believe me, too.",
  "lucky for you, i can take a joke.",

  "to come watch him be a rock star?",
  "and now we want to keep it going.",
  "you want every hot dog in the store?",
  "i better be heading home to my family.",
  "and for once it's not 'cause some drunk",
  "he's got a lot of thinking to do.",
  "are you just buying this to be nice?",
  "the place to get drunk is at home.",
  "are we there yet? look out the window!",
  "we will send you back to your planet,",
  "thank god it's just like her busy box.",

  "...and he came up with this system.",
  "i guess for a couple months there...",
  "yeah, okay. we'll talk about it later.",
  "how did you come up with that?",
  "yes, the old ways are still best at los pollos hermanos.",
  "but don't take my word for it.",
  "- who would have called to warn you? - i don't know.",
  "...ten being your normal level of feeling and one being no feeling at all.",
  "no, that's not going to work!",
  "ladies, thank you. thank you. good job. come back here.",
  "jesus was just a man.",
  "you know, you put nose in it and breathed in, it was...",
  "well, i just thought i'd stop by,",
  "you really want to do this now?",
  "ain't top-shelf, but we could at least move it.",
  "we have the money, more than enough. walt earned it.",
  "and so that's how this all started. for better or worse...",
  "you have to try and understand",
  "...he went right back to gambling. i mean, that's how deep this went.",
  "surprised he doesn't make us do that.",
  "...we need to take this very seriously.",
  "so i need your answer right now.",
  "- yeah, come on. - just make it count.",
  "why do you keep asking me that?",
  "why don't you just leave him be?",
  "...because then we knew what was up.",
  "it was a lot better after that.",
  "and plus, my daughter wasn't born yet.",
  "i mean, a fly. a housefly.",
  "so you're chasing around a fly and in your world, i'm the idiot.",
  "i've never even seen.",
  "look, let me just top it off, all right, really quick.",
  "i don't think so. where is it?",
  "you ever have, like, a wild animal trapped in your house?",
  "what's up with that? i mean, when i was coming up, it was just possum.",
  "sometimes i'd see him outside at night and it would just, you know, freeze.",
  "freeze! just freeze.",
  "...you want them to actually miss you, you know?",
  "i mean, no matter how well i explain it...",
  "i didn't put it together until after the crash when he was all over the news.",
  "you're going to break your neck.",
  "i will say it again. a door.",
  "...and you might not even get why.",
  "all right, here we go. you ready?",
  "nope. nope, that's it. take me up.",
  "it's not so easy like you think.",
  "yeah, yeah, yeah. way ahead of you.",
  "i mean, it doesn't make any sense.",
  "like i said, i got nothing here.",
  "i was, then i saw your car.",
  "well, it's a little late on that.",
  "what are you two even doing here?",
  "that's it? that's what you wanna buy?",
  "has nothing to do with the story.",
  "you're the one who brought it up.",
  "...i don't know what you've been through.",
  "you can tell me if you want.",
  "you get that out of my house.",
  "...who's paid to look the other way.",
  "...but i never get to make it.",
  "i mean, not very much at all.",
  "and one must learn to be rich.",
  "you think you could hook me up?",
  "i don't need everyone staring at me hanging here like a camel's ball sack.",
  "i don't want to be the heavy here, but honestly, guys,",
  "flo. come on, man, don't be like that.",
  "i think i'd be good with either an old iroc or a 'stang.",
  "...only the very best with just the right amount of dirty.",
  "let me bottom-line this for you:",
  "- i thought you had a meeting. - i did, but we changed the time.",
  "...but he knows what he's doing.",
  "and safe and cautious is you not being involved in this at all.",
  "...and it worked because i believed it, all right?",
  "you buy this place, all you got is a big building that squirts water.",
  "and you seriously wanna get high?",
  "people who say guess what and then actually expect you to guess...",
  "i'm not leaving until",
  "you'll be just as comfortable at home as you are here.",
  "the... equipment that you have here, that you need. short-term.",
  "- hi. do you have a minute? - yeah.",
  "where do you want me to start?",
  "yes, it's ours. now put it away.",
  "and you know he's not the first.",
  "they used him to shoot my friend.",
  "because i just found out about them.",
  "i can't move my legs. got it?",
  "then by the time he gets out...",
  "you understand what you have to do?",
  "...these guys are using kids like that.",
  "- and? - well, i'm not gonna do it.",
  "and i told him to be quiet.",
  "just trying to do the right thing.",
  "but two weeks later he killed her.",
  "gonna need you to come with me.",
  "hey. hey, hey, hey, hey. what are you doing?",
  "you have to let me in. please.",
  "hey, it's me. wait for the thing.",
  "you're a sweet girl. yes, you are. yes, you are.",
  "...to make the best out of a very bad situation, yes.",
  "i'm just not buying it. no, i think it would be better...",
  "they use kids because hey, why not? easy to control. easy to fool.",
  "we're not even talking about money!",
  "you know how it is.",
  "know how you know? because you're not in prison right now.",
  "we're going to figure it out.",
  "apples and oranges. do i really have to sit here and explain the difference?",
  "why didn't you go after these guys two or three months ago?",
  "well, it sounds like you're saying",
  "yeah, well, unfortunately rules are rules,",
  "what about people on crutches? maybe i should be in here too.",
  "is that what you're trying to say?",
  "why didn't you tell me? let's wait then. that's a joke. the kid ain't coming.",
  "okay, so we pay him off.",
  "no, no, it's not about money. it's about getting him off the streets.",
  "listen to me. you have one friend in this room. this man.",
  "if it wasn't for this man and the respect i have for him...",
  "working on anything you can talk about?",
  "- well, just remember i get a cut. - all right. it's a deal.",
  "take as much time as you need.",
  "yes, uh, well, as you can see, there's otana now.",
  "- it's a nice big living room. - yeah.",
  "they're all pretty good size and... oh, this is the first one here.",
  "this is as good as it gets.",
  "we've got nowhere to go but up.",
  "if it makes you feel any better,",
  "put your arms out. they're out.",
  "then again, maybe he thought it was you who gave the order.",
  "he has enough money to last forever, he knows he needs to keep moving.",
  "i saved his life, i owed him that, but now he and i are done.",
  "you kill me right here and now.",
  "- plus, there's that big nose of his. - that's not a nose, that's a horn.",
  "- they keep you prisoner. - i don't do nothing for them ever.",
  "how's her driving? driving. is she good behind the wheel?",
  "i strongly recommend that you return our calls next time.",
  "however you like things to be done is exactly how we're gonna do them.",
  "and not to sound cold-blooded, but i am running a business here.",
  "there's so much overhead that i can't afford to shut down.",
  "but as he cannot or will not tell me how long that might be...",
  "there's always more for me to learn.",
  "but i'm thinking that if we had...",
  "i know that when the time comes, you will be ready.",
  "i'll show you when we get there.",
  "whatever the hell this is.",
  "so then, where's the trust?",
  "now tell me where to find him. you know it's the right thing.",
  "look, if i was to tell you, well, i just... i couldn't live with myself.",
  "but who's to say i didn't write the address down in my day planner?",
  "do not touch anything on my desk.",
  "you know, maybe that the only thing saving me is gale's fastidiousness.",
  "there's got to be some other way.",
  "the dea would love you, all the shit you could tell them.",
  "that's the one thing i'm certain of, production cannot stop.",
  "...and i can't do it in the lab, victor's always there.",
  "but i need you to track him, get me his address.",
  "there won't be any more trouble.",
  "- no. ...i can make him understand.",
  "like you said, he's the problem. he's always been the problem.",
  "and i can take you to him.",
  "- what do you say? - where is he?",
  "just what the hell was that exactly?",
  "- why? - because your boss is gonna need me.",
  "and then what? i'm gonna need some...",
  "- you get your car fixed? - not yet.",
  "you're gonna wanna get your car fixed.",
  "- i could get right on that. - no.",
  "you're a business... the lady out front...",
  "...i guess would do it. i suppose.",
  "...to make it look like an accident.",
  "no, i just... my phone. i'll just...",
  "you... you don't have to do this.",
  "...but it's gonna be him.",
  "i would just like to point out",
  "...i know that you want the best.",
  "people? he get himself seen by these people?",
  "and thank you, big time, as always.",
  "and as angry as he may be, i don't believe he's willing...",

  "he keeps me in the loop, always has time for a phone call. it's...",
  "i heard you broke new ground today.",
  "...yeah, i guess i broke new ground.",
  "oh, you don't know what the hell you're doing, do you?",
  "he didn't deserve what happened to him.",
  "how would you even know it?",
  "let us just go back to work.",
  "any thoughts on what our next move might be?",
  "- what do you mean? - i mean prove it!",
  "not unless you're gonna be sitting.",
  "but if you did have to use it, wouldn't it still be better to use one...",
  "dude, you got to lead with this shit.",
  "it looks like you're looking at a rock.",
  "would you like some more detail? because i can give it to you.",
  "i mean, if we can't even say what it is, why are we buying it at all?",

  "you got a real nice place here.",
  "be a shame if something happened to it. that angle.",
  "what? that you had to send your woman",
  "bad idea. this is a bad idea.",
  "you're my husband and i love you,",
  "this job has just gotten too stressful and difficult, and it's time to quit.",
  "young lady, what's the matter with you?",
  "okay, then. so we're good to go.",
  "no, no, no, this is a mistake.",
  "anyway, i shouldn't take up any more of your time.",
  "tell me why you shut me down.",
  "it's been hard on her.",
  "despite my best efforts, no. they want my help on a case.",
  "if you could just come take a look.",
  "yes, 879 was the original offer, but that seems high to me now.",
  "you are a very pretty lady.",
  "i'm sorry we couldn't make it work. goodbye.",
  "if you think about it, really think about it...",
  "so they just named it after him.",
  "do you think eisenheim's behind all this?",
  "the final decision is whether or not to hit or to stand. hit it.",
  "we need to get our stories straight",
  "appearing to come clean will be the best thing for everyone.",
  "that we are buying a car wash.",
  "where are you getting all this money?",
  "we want them to understand why you could do something so stupid.",
  "it's to show contrition. well, i just wouldn't use that word.",
  "do i really need to answer that?",
  "i can't seem to find that anywhere.",
  "- what? - you don't have to mean it.",
  "that we can all support each other.",
  "with your left hand or your right hand?",
  "it's all right. i got it.",
  "anyway, you get the idea.",
  "you know, really can make a difference.",
  "for the better part of a year.",
  "guy's got to be responsible.",
  "i don't know. i think so. yeah.",
  "god, i wanted to get this guy.",
  "no, i mean, you know, me personally, you know?",
  "what about the person who killed him?",
  "- i need to talk to you. - okay.",
  "did you say anything to each other?",
  "- who wants to make a hundred bucks? - yeah.",
  "but once he goes after something,",
  "now, how long before gus decides that he's too big of a risk?",
  "we already told our family about it.",
  "and when my contract is up, i'll just simply hang it all up,",
  "oh, i can do that.",
  "all right i will definitely do that",
  "you'd better be ready in two minutes, because l am right outside your door.",
  "outside your door",
  "are you all right? does he have a gun on you?",
  "we gotta do this six more times today with a lot of miles in between.",
  "i wish i could help you there.",
  "if i get any kind of hit, i'll keep you in the loop on that.",
  "no, i know. i get it, really.",
  "this is why i'm out here, right?",
  "it's my call? i know it's my call!",
  "- shut up! shut up! - shut up, sit down...",
  "- we'll be looking for you. - i'll be there.",
  "...then we have to promise each other...",
  "i have to get back to work.",
  "that's one of the many, many things he does around the lab...",
  "this dude was coming right at me with a shotgun.",
  "but i know better than to ask.",
  "so coming into a business that's up and running...",
  "we're going to have lunch, you know.",
  "yeah, i do. i think it's possible.",
  "not you. i'm talking about your baby sister. i wouldn't let you near my car.",
  "i would get my car washed there if i saw her face out front.",
  "we came together,",
  "well, it needed to be done.",
  "i don't see how that can be bad.",
  "you know, the one... he's dead now. um, uh...",
  "hey, i can't believe these words are gonna come out of my mouth...",
  "you want me to make some coffee?",
  "what exactly did i say last night?",
  "was it the people you work for?",
  "...that the man he was looking for might still be out there.",
  "things that you don't want to talk about.",
  "at least this would all be over.",
  "who are you talking to right now?",
  "who is it you think you see?",
  "but maybe when you are the boss...",
  "you want me to call her back?",
  "- when? - tomorrow! she's coming home tomorrow!",
  "you're not moving back in, are you?",
  "but you do have to wash your hands.",
  "do you really believe that you mean anything to these people?",
  "i see they can't outright kill me, but they don't want me getting high.",
  "...gus can't kill you because of me, he knows i won't stand for it.",
  "we sit here and watch that house...",
  "guess we'll go with plan a, then.",
  "i don't know. how deep do you think it is?",
  "hey, you mind taking over for a minute?",
  "i don't want any trouble.",
  "hey, wait a second. wait a minute.",
  "set up a meeting. let's see what they have to say.",
  "did you get the car wash keys?",
  "...and i'm sorry to be so forward.",
  "...i do it to protect this family.",
  "he hasn't said a word.",
  "yes, thank you. the name is white.",
  "i mean, closer than you and me right now.",
  "he said he sees things in people.",
  "he said he sees something in me.",
  "does that make any sense to you?",
  "he says he sees something in you.",
  "what kind of game is he playing?",
  "he can't truly think that you'd forget--",
  "and told you, no more children. but that very night, that little boy,",
  "- it's good to see you. - you, too.",
  "that could do this kind of business.",
  "you go after him with a gun, you'll never get out of it alive.",
  "you'll never get out alive.",
  "there shouldn't be any taste or smell.",
  "whatever you do, don't smoke it.",
  "yeah, i barely got it around the block",
  "and mom said we couldn't afford it, so they took it back.",
  "yeah, yeah, yeah, i hear you.",
  "it's a pleasure to see you.",
  "i must apologize. if i had seen you come in,",
  "and how are your mother and father?",
  "uh, i don't know about this one. he might eat up all your profits.",
  "i'll let you finish your meal. can l get you anything else?",
  "nobody's asking you to give up yours.",
  "what's going on with you these days?",
  "why did you kill him?",
  "no matter how many dogs i kill, i just, what, do an inventory and accept?",
  "why l'm here in the first place...",
  "bring a light over here, will you?",
  "but now i get this crazy idea",
  "and theologians trying to make sense",
  "i mean, this is my dad we're talking about!",
  "a mistake made by his own men.",
  "yeah, no, i get what you're saying,",
  "i'm gonna hear some bad news.",
  "i'd eat there every day but i wouldn't fit through the door.",
  "it was a week later that he...",
  "it was perhaps a week later when i read about him in the paper.",
  "the paper made no mention of that.",
  "...than what would or could have been a very promising career.",
  "...and i thought a lot of him.",
  "can you tell us where you were...",
  "and then a few years later,",
  "oh, no, no, no thank you, please.",
  "still, why are we hearing it now?",
  "...on a person not making phone calls.",
  "- that's a pretty good deal. - you kidding me? that's a great deal.",
  "plus there's a little extra in there for any move-related incidentals.",
  "...why don't you go see for yourself?",
  "i can't prove it,",
  "i mean, you know these guys with their...",
  "...something deep down says he's my guy.",
  "...what i need for you to do...",
  "it's known as extralegal. but trust me, it's our little secret.",
  "no, i mean it. this is a mistake.",
  "are you gonna make me beg? come on. just stick it in there.",
  "may i help you with your order?",
  "did you hear what i just said?",
  "oh. how would you know that?",
  "don't let him get too crazy, okay?",
  "now, i would appreciate it if you would apologise.",
  "i guess we'd better get started.",
  "hey, red. you got one of those for me?",
  "there, there. it's all right now.",
  "so, what have you been up to?",
  "but no more than five years old. airbags, safety-rated, all that.",
  "or should i just go ahead and--",
  "i just wanted to tell you that...",
  "i'll find another one.",
  "just, you know, give me a call.",
  "i really need to talk to you.",
  "i can't have this in my life.",
  "look, i don't want you to worry, okay?",
  "makes sense to get rid of him for good.",
  "if something were to happen to him, would you have a problem with that?",
  "is he doing anything about that, or do we keep hanging out",
  "this is all falling into place now.",
  "we'll eat first, and then we'll talk.",
  "that is not what i asked you.",
  "with your family or whatever, but this is important,",
  "but the important thing is, i'm hoping to have sex.",
  "-i should-- -yeah. sit down.",
  "it's like what you call a rock-and-a-hard-place situation.",
  "i mean, if l mess this up,",
  "then who told you all of that?",
  "and you were right there. you were in his house,",
  "everything i have done, i have done for you,",
  "you killed me, is what you've done!",
  "i really wanted to do this together but i can hear him getting up.",
  "could you do me a favor?",
  "i don't understand why i'm here.",
  "and this was... wow, eight years ago.",
  "i don't know. i have no idea.",
  "- this may take some time? - at least several hours.",
  "i'm the guy your boss brought here to show you how it's done.",
  "i don't know what else to do.",
  "can we just keep this between us?",
  "and i remember the smell in there, the chemicals.",
  "it was as if they used up...",
  "...but the only thing i could remember...",
  "okay. you bet. say hi to the kids for me.",
  "a decision you made, by the way.",
  "it's really at the point now...",
  "that's the third time you've asked.",
  "- i don't wanna get into it, okay? - no, it's not okay.",
  "i'm just saying i'm here, you know.",
  "if you want to talk about it.",
  "i don't want to talk about it!",
  "hey, you think he needs more blood?",
  "because, at the end of the day,",
  "well, ted, the whole reason we're in this mess...",
  "...they will come after you and then they will come after me.",
  "i'm still going to go bankrupt and lose my business and my home.",
  "just because i pay some stupid fine doesn't make my life any less ruined.",
  "the leases are ironclad, so i have to see what's possible...",
  "...but, yeah, i'm gonna do my best.",
  "write a new check.",
  "i believe you have met him before.",
  "besides, it gives me a chance to see how you work a case.",
  "- i'll do it. - no, you won't.",
  "fair enough, fair enough.",
  "the three of us can hang out and play cards or watch tv...",
  "just one minute. that's all i ask.",
  "he doesn't think you need me anymore.",
  "come on, i don't even know the guy's name.",
  "you know, tell him where to meet us?",
  "you say whatever you have to say. you just give me an hour to...",
  "give me an hour and then you make the phone call. don't forget. please.",
  "let mr. white go.",
  "it doesn't matter, because right now",
  "this is how it has to be.",
  "- great. so you'll do it. - oh, i don't know.",
  "no, no, no. there's got to be another way.",
  "hank, i've got a car wash to run.",
  "i mean, you don't honestly believe that i'm in danger, do you? me?",
  "- because we are all in danger here. - we're not all in danger here.",
  "whoa, whoa, whoa. wait a minute.",
  "do you see why this can't continue?",
  "are we going to have a problem?",
  "so what are you going to do?",
  "...number, and the reason for your call. thank you.",
  "hey, need to hear from you. hope i made myself clear about that.",
  "call me as soon as you can.",
  "- what's up? he's waiting for me. - hold up. hold up.",
  "stop...! stop calling me that!",
  "what the hell is your problem?",
  "he didn't show up for work today.",
  "- you can bring that with you. - okay.",
  "- let me in, let me in! - no way! let go!",
  "it's just a matter of time now.",
  "no. no, you son of a bitch. you know what you did.",
  "and only you and i were the only two people on earth who knew about it.",
  "that's the plan? was that the plan?",
  "i'm not lying. just listen to me. what would i have to gain?",
  "...waiting for gus to send one of his men to kill me.",
  "and not only does he have that...",
  "no, he has known everything all along.",
  "where were you today? in the lab?",
  "i'm going to keep telling them that.",
  "unless the family wants you in there, you're not allowed.",
  "you need to be at work, now.",
  "i already told you. i'm not going.",
  "...make sure he gets whatever he needs.",
  "jesus. what did you say to him?",
  "i'm sorry, i didn't catch your name.",
  "so if i get tired of talking, can i get up and leave?",
  "you know where he is... don't you?",
  "look, let me explain something to you.",
  "whoopty-freakingdoo. why do you think he's not here?",
  "and how's that news, exactly, the two of you being in danger?",
  "...and i'm sorry to do this, but do you still have the key?",
  "you do? good. and would you be willing to...?",
  "so you gonna get me out of here?",
  "thanks for that, by the way.",
  "just as soon as i can",
  "should we try this one more time?",
  "it's just him, alone in his room.",
  "how are things looking over there?",
  "oh, i've heard of that place.",
  "anyhoo, as soon as erlich comes in",
  "serious - you don't have the tv on? seriously?",
  "he didn't tell us, but he was.",
  "- yeah. - i mean, even more so than before.",
  "come on. come on, you, be nice. be nice.",
  "do you even know what you've done?",
  "and of course, when i say us, i'm including you.",
  "could you tell me that, at least?",
  "what the hell difference does it make?",
  "who are you and what are you going to do?",
  "i don't believe i said that, no.",
  "speak now or forever sing soprano. what's up with that, by the way?",
  "what are you looking at me for?",
  "all right, i'm just down the hall.",
  "i told them it was an accident.",
  "it's, like, 8 feet away. is this cool? is this close enough?",
  "mr. white, let's get out of here.",
  "so you tell me, answer man, did all that even work just now?",
  "okay. so you took it upon yourself...",
  "we're done when i say we're done.",
  "but i don't know that, you know?",
  "well, look, did you check your house?",
  "- your car? did you check your car? - no.",
  "mike, i know you don't care for me.",
  "but if that is not the case, i want to know it...",
  "i had him out to my house.",
  "i have had enough.",
  "see, i'm more interested in why gus fring decided to put a guy like you...",
  "you wanna state that for the camera?",
  "you can tell us what you know...",
  "i don't know anything about any money.",
  "...but it was too dark, too small...",
  "...not to mention it could've broken down at any moment.",
  "but i don't wanna drive too far. no more 50-mile treks to some indian reservation.",
  "it's me. you got a minute?",
  "how much was she gonna pay you?",
  "two good men died because of you.",
  "i don't care. you have to promise. you have to promise me.",
  "...then we've got nothing to worry about.",
  "i will, if it comes to that.",
  "- you got any roadie cases? - for sure. what size?",
  "that's cool. i guess we better hit it then.",
  "now, you need a name for them?",
  "i understand you were in the hospital.",
  "so you're gonna get them all, right?",
  "i mean, you know, she's not stupid. she knows i'm into something, but...",
  "she could make a pretty good guess.",
  "no, really. i want you to guess.",
  "i mean, god knows where he'd be if we had to go through his health plan.",
  "- okay, come on. - wait, wait, wait.",
  "- this is it. - wait. wait for it.",
  "and do you know where they are now?",
  "so we are gonna make them whole.",
  "this is your problem. it should come out of your end.",
  "how are you feeling about the money?",
  "what would you give me for it?",
  "besides, ron was my guy. remember? i don't have a guy anymore.",
  "yes, seriously. and if you show me...",
  "why on earth would we do that?",
  "listen, i know these last few weeks have been rough.",
  "you know, i want us to try and start looking forward to things again.",
  "guy's some piece of work, isn't he?",
  "six feet under and half a face, he's still screwing with us.",
  "- bye-bye. - drive safe.",
  "and this would go on and on...",
  "come on! how am i supposed to -?",
  "that's the one i erased from the inventory, so it has to be that one.",
  "she's gonna try and get some sleep.",
  "just the thing for both of you.",
  "i don't want the children here anymore.",
  "so wait. now that you're in charge...",
  "trying to protect my children from me?",
  "he's in the hospital because of me.",
  "i got them out of this house.",
  "make it clear we need more time.",
  "i will count every minute that the kids are away from here...",
  "...was it you or was it her?",
  "she's thinking if she makes it look like her inventory's being watched...",
  "i think it's the way to go.",
  "the person who gave me this present...",
  "- that's nice. let me see that. - yeah.",
  "i mean, as long as you got the money to spend, that is.",
  "she said she needed to, you know, keep her mind occupied, and...",
  "i'm not good at that.",
  "i think you're great with the kids. i think you're great with the kids.",
  "remember how you like to do that?",
  "so i was just wondering if maybe your people put it there.",
  "oh, come on! you are not seriously still considering killing me?",
  "just give him a minute, would you?",
  "that has nothing to do with this.",
  "some of them even know about you, assuming you're the master chemist...",
  "i gave him a list of names...",
  "none, if you do it right here. if a freight train is stopped in transit...",
  "you know what this means, don't you?",
  "- how many in the crew? - just two.",
  "you broke it, you pay for it. and we've talked about this plenty already.",
  "it's perfect. yeah, we do it here.",
  "just come out and talk to me.",
  "- what's going on? - you got what you wanted, that's what.",
  "i won't change my mind about you.",
  "yeah, man. give me a little credit.",
  "you sure you're not out of gas?",
  "i've been thinking about this all day.",
  "well, it's not like i wanted to.",
  "...i was looking out for the team. i didn't want to kill him.",
  "yeah, but i just want to make sure",
  "- is that how we do business now? - i understand you're upset.",
  "we keep him close. under our control.",
  "write the time down. roll on it.",
  "then again. i don't read the farm report.",
  "just gotta be there when he does.",
  "i know dave helped me so much when i was going through my little...",
  "i need to make the right decision.",
  "i just want to be with them.",
  "...there are things you just don't know...",
  "you might consider doing that as well.",
  "how long has this been going on?",
  "and you're just telling me this now?",
  "- you know this can't go on, right? - yeah, i know.",
  "you won't have to worry about that anymore.",
  "it's more money than i've ever seen.",
  "and when it comes down to it...",
  "i wouldn't be here if i wasn't.",
  "i was surprised to get your call.",
  "- his territory won't impact yours. - you see, that doesn't work for me.",
  "could spend some time together.",
  "- no, mr. white. i'm gonna go. - stay.",
  "my mom always made them like that.",
  "the car wash. mr. white said it's going really well.",
  "oh, you know, just good stuff.",
  "no, walter. the last thing i need to do is listen to you. now, sit down.",
  "so if we just waste you right here right now...",
  "see how that works? there's only us.",
  "my partner tells me that your crew...",
  "i need you to listen to me.",
  "we're not gonna give up this deal...",
  "...than you ever would on your own.",
  "you all know exactly who i am.",
  "we'll get it out of your hair.",
  "what'd you bring me this time?",
  "...and he wants to buy a boat.",
  "but actually, i've got an extra one for you this week. 603.",
  "- sure. no problem. - no problem.",
  "yeah, i think we need to talk about",
  "you're every bit as good as me.",
  "i'll-i'll figure it out, all right?",
  "look, i know how upset you are about what happened to this boy.",
  "but because it happened, what, am i supposed to just lie down...",
  "it makes me sick that it happened...",
  "if you believe that there's a hell, i don't know if you're into that...",
  "and it's not wrong to want it. okay?",
  "you're not done. you're not leaving. because if you leave, you get nothing!",
  "i'll work on it. it'll get better.",
  "don't play favourites. you got a bigger job than that.",
  "he's just living a boring old-man life like he has nothing left to hide.",
  "- tell me something good. - you tell me.",
  "sweated the guy for 14 hours. that should be some kind of record.",
  "i don't owe you a damn thing.",
  "you just had to be the man.",
  "no, i stayed off the main streets and kept checking, so...",
  "i don't want to... i don't want to talk about this.",
  "- do you want a coffee or something? - not just now.",
  "this is what i do, you understand?",
  "i'm very careful who i work with.",
  "lydia, learn to take yes for an answer.",
  "this has gotta be fast and quiet.",
  "where do you suppose these come from?",
  "dinner will be in about an hour.",
  "back in college, i'd spend my days...",
  "oh, my god! look at her go!",
  "where'd you go? i can't see you. where'd you go?",
  "it's so nice to see you smile again.",
  "and i'm very, very proud of you...",
  "this is what you've been working for.",
  "i didn't... i didn't know what else to do.",
  "it was just so much, so fast.",
  "you aren't either, so there you go.",
  "not enough hours in the day, right?",
  "- no, i'm good. i'm good, thank you. - yeah? all right.",
  "hey, buddy. ready for a cold one?",
  "let's go send them on their way.",
  "okay. you okay? just take a breath.",
  "this is not what i agreed to.",
  "i'm only asking for a few days.",
  "you're putting me in a box here.",
  "i got it. have a good day.",
  "if i'd known it was you, well...",
  "things have been quiet on this end.",
  "uh, thing is, what those folks want",
  "and, kid, you might wanna think about",
  "- you've looked better. - just get it done.",
  "no. no. don't. just hold onto it.",
  "i've been out for about a month.",
  "and that's not how you do things.",
  "the last time that i saw him,",
  "are you gonna turn off the light?",
  "i didn't even know we had that.",
  "he hasn't been to work all week.",
  "be there. should be a big crowd.",
  "i've been better, but... i don't know.",
  "i mean, when one of these things",
  "i wanna beat this thing. i do.",
  "but the truth is in six months,",
  "if you don't know who i am...",
  "you make her get off the phone.",
  "she didn't say where she was going.",
  "so much makes sense to me now.",
  "if what i know is true, if...",
  "the balls on that son of a--",
  "they're all part of the story, right?",
  "but i'll tell you it's a fact,",
  "i've been around long enough to know.",
  "so believe me when i tell you",
  "we need to go get the kids,",
  "- am i under arrest? - no, no, no.",
  "we are here to do a job,",
  "really. how much worse could it be,",
  "and once we take care of that,",
  "you don't know? what do you mean you don't know?",
  "- what are you doing? - hey, hey, hey.",
  "i am not leaving here without her.",
  "you pass it on to our children.",
  "okay, you can take it off now.",
  "what will it hurt to show me?",
  "look, he learned from him, all right?",
  "i wanna use guys that i trust,",
  "and that's the end of the conversation",
  "ten seconds after i tell this story,",
  "so come on, buddy. share with us.",
  "i promise you we can hold out",
  "do you know about that money thing?",
  "and he, like, figured it all out",
  "'cause we only got a few minutes.",
  "which, you know, is what he does.",
  "so i jump off the moving train.",
  "well, whatever, man. it's a good movie.",
  "lying to me for over a year,",
  "okay, i'm gonna try to remain calm,",
  "did you hit your head or something?",
  "and asked me to stay for dinner.",
  "yeah. here. sit down for a second.",
  "what now is that we go on.",
  "and my doctor says i'm doing great.",
  "and what would really help me out",
  "way past time. we talked about this.",
  "how can we believe anything you say?",
  "to put this on top of that?",
  "and showed me just how much money",
  "i wanted to go to the police,",
  "i... all i could think to do",
  "i just wanted the best for you.",
  "just him being there all by himself,",
  "maybe it's time for you to just...",

  "yeah, but what she actually said was,",
  "i read you loud and clear. over.",
  "on what we think of the parents.",
  "good thing we got here in time.",
  "yeah, we got him. he's in his...",
  "- it didn't. - on the count of three.",
  "unless you have a problem with that.",
  "hey, did i do something to you?",
  "what? no, i don't care about that.",
  "- what in the world? - are you kidding?",
  "you are obviously trying to get me",
  "we should just arrest him right here.",
  "what? what do you have to do?",
  "okay, and if you'll just follow me.",
  "you have got to know the difference",
  "i'm not familiar with who that is.",
  "would never have fit on her fingers,",
  "he's gonna make the drop. let's go.",
  "- let's get back on the case. - yes.",

  "- i'm gonna handle this for you. - okay.",
  "i saw what you did right there.",
  "tell my wife that i love her...",
  "by how far apart we were standing.",

  "i mean, i hope you found peace.",
  "hey, so everybody knows about us now,",
  "what do you want to do, then?",
  "what do you want me to say?",
  "we tried really hard. we made rules.",

  "i'm just so excited about all this!",
  "all right, so what do i do?",
  "but i am gonna go over there.",
  "i'm gonna tell her how i feel.",
  "i did it 'cause it's my job.",
  "now, i know we have our history,",
  "things are gonna get much, much worse.",
  "anyway, we came up with a plan.",
  "and i believe it's 'cause we're just",
  "because you left this in my back.",
  "but what i could do, for totally",
  "we're like rock stars to these people.",
  "we lie, tell him we broke up,",
  "i really think this is gonna work.",
  "she says she likes that about us.",
  "oh, right, you used to work here.",
  "yes, well, i know my way out.",
  "but that's not what this is about.",
  "and that none of us liked him.",

  "i don't know why this is happening.",
  "this is what i have so far.",
  "maybe you should lose the word pain",
  "excuse me, could you stop playing that?",
  "all right, just give it to me.",
  "all right, how did you do that?",
  "from being a man of the world.",
  "whoa, whoa, whoa. can we slow down?",
  "my friends are just in my head.",
  "and your husband was only my captain",
  "yeah, but this is a good one.",
  "probably won't work, but i said it",
  "and now for a message of hope.",
  "but i'm not giving up on us.",
  "i just care about being with you...",
  "look, i don't want to break up.",
  "why do you want to do that?",
  "because i'm a higher level of being,",
  "because they were gonna throw him away,",
  "i sleep on the floor. me too.",
  "i think it's a great idea, sir.",
  "how do i look? you look great.",
  "i've got a good feeling about this.",
  "and i've got that feeling about you.",

  "that was a nice thing to do.",
  "go get your girlfriend out of prison.",
  "oh, it's so much more than that.",
  "sorry, i always wanted to say that.",
  "when you could literally pick them up",
  "a month from today is my birthday.",
  "did you choose us because we're women?",
  "this is an amazing use of time.",
  "i'm gonna work the case in secret.",
  "we're gonna work the case in secret.",
  "you didn't even get the right guy.",
  "i think i just figured something out.",
  "no, no, no, shut up and look.",
  "no, no, we can't be seen together.",
  "i shouldn't even be talking to you.",
  "could learn a little something from me.",
  "i'm about to have my third kid,",

  "fine, you may call him for me.",
  "and he's headed to the break room.",
  "did he go back and get it?",
  "if you're not allowed to say it?",
  "i wouldn't have it any other way.",

  "which means i am the acting captain.",
  "i'd like to introduce you to someone.",
  "what is it? did you see something?",
  "also, i know you're not supposed to,",
  "how did i not see that coming?",
  "hey, we've got a lot to do.",
  "is that not how you spell it?",
  "seeing him so happy made me believe",
  "so i, like, have a dog now?",
  "you had no right to take ours.",
  "i didn't ask you to do that.",
  "if it didn't make my brain burn.",
  "and you're gonna grow the hell up.",
  "i can't wait to eat your food.",
  "which means it might be a code.",
  "how am i the bad guy here?",
  "ah, you don't have to thank me.",
  "i want to say a few words.",
  "you don't have to get over it.",
  "hey, don't make any new best friends.",
  "my trip here from the train station...",
  "i hadn't seen her in a while.",

  "to see you much on your visit.",
  "look, i don't know who they sent,",
  "okay, but you're making a big mistake.",
  "actually, it says i'm a fall risk.",
  "thank you so much. you're the best.",
  "that guy was trying to kill me.",
  "do you ask them to be quiet?",
  "i don't care, but i do care,",
  "i didn't realize we had more questions",
  "i mean, it's impossible to find here.",
  "sorry to do this to you, man.",
  "no, that is not what i'm saying!",
  "just remember, you got a fine lady.",
  "what are you still standing there for?",
  "i thought we could talk under here",
  "i should help bring him back in.",
  "yeah, we should get out of here.",
  "is walking really so hard for you?",
  "think i'm getting the hang of it.",
  "- and ruined our lives. - you know what?",

  "and i haven't met anyone i like.",
  "i was just trying to protect you",
  "and i could only talk to him...",
  "i'll go on a date with you.",
  "my first partner was also pretty cool.",
  "- his pants were too tight. - ah, yeah.",

  "you know what? i like this song!",
  "- what do we do? - eat the note!",
  "they don't go out in the field.",
  "don't worry, sir. i can handle this.",
  "i think you owe me an apology.",
  "he's been gone an hour, maybe two.",
  "what? he didn't believe in you either.",
  "i said my oh, boy too soon.",
  "you hear me? i will kill you!",
  "is because you said we were great.",

  "- i like it. do you? - i did.",
  "i'm sorry that i didn't trust you.",
  "why don't you give me those eggs?",
  "to clean the place up before then.",
  "- how'd you get in? - door was open.",
  "this'll probably go faster if we split up.",
  "you don't just throw those things away?",

  "why don't i just kick things off.",
  "okay, your hands are already all up,",
  "- i have a glass eye. - glass eye?",
  "what do you bring to the table?",
  "because i didn't want to forget it?",
  "hey, can you guys keep it down?",
  "well, the only reason we're killing it",
  "and if he were here right now,",
  "did i want it to be wet?",
  "do i actually have to kill you?",

  "you didn't give me anything to do.",
  "tell everyone what you saw here today.",
  "can you imagine? i would look amazing.",
  "well, if you want to do that,",
  "because the police are looking for us.",

  "really? we gotta go take him down.",
  "so let's just take him with us.",
  "look, can you please just get out?",
  "i'm not even thinking about it anymore.",
  "- but i want to apologize. - for what?",

  "the only reason you won is 'cause",
  "no one knew you were even playing.",
  "it most certainly is, but don't worry.",
  "you can have that back in three...",
  "but i'm glad she's on my team.",
  "so... how are we gonna do it?",
  "with ones that lock from the outside.",
  "of course, you could break the window,",
  "i don't think that's the best idea.",
  "do you swear i can trust you?",
  "you had it for breakfast this morning.",
  "we were out here the whole time.",
  "and now it's time to send in",
  "i could not have been more clearly",

  "but you know how these things go,",
  "for the last time, i don't know.",
  "i've been working here the whole time.",

  "remember, we made up that little song.",
  "unless you make it in a toilet.",
  "- wow, you are taking this so well.",
  "since you two are such good friends,",
  "and my mother made me fix it.",
  "until you learn how to fix this.",
  "- well, i wouldn't put it that way.",
  "but the point is the only person",
  "of your family business, but i'm afraid",
  "i actually used your car for that.",
  "- well, i just mean we'll fix it.",

  "yes, it is. that's why i broke up with him.",
  "so why was he at your party?",
  "and like an idiot, i believed you.",
  "why can't all guys be like you?",
  "because if all guys were like me, the human race couldn't survive.",
  "that's right, you saw what you saw.",
  "or we could just have a life.",
  "your head goes on the other end.",
  "tell you what i'm going to do.",

  "what are you talking about? it's fine, she bought it, it's over.",
  "excuse me, we just went over this.",
  "- no. - then don't ask me how i'm feeling.",
  "- why? - they asked me to come in.",
  "- howard, listen to me. - hang on. call waiting.",
  "okay, sweetie. i'll take care of you. what do you need?",

  "i can't feel my fingers. hurry up.",
  "damn. okay, i'll just take the roof.",
  "time-travel joke. it's not-- never mind.",

  "okay, let me just tell...",
  "that you thought, 'hey, oh my god.",
  "i looked over the board, and it turns out you were right.",
  "- wait. you have to drive me home. - how did you get here?",
  "because i didn't come home last night.",
  "that would probably save us some time.",
  "the problem isn't what's on the inside. it's the creepy candy coating.",
  "will you at least think about it?",
  "the great thing about ernie was he never asked me for anything.",
  "i can buy all these things online. i come here for the personal service.",
  "...and billy sparks, who lived down the street from me...",
  "and then, oh, i... i told her...",
  "oh, cool. so you could study me.",
  "i use them. i don't like them.",
  "she might be dying and, you know, wouldn't want to miss that.",
  "okay, does she lay out your clothes for you in the morning...",
  "which will be about as effective as plan a.",
  "- i can't. - sure you can. do it. do it.",
  "...i've got plans doing something i like, so it's good.",
  "by the way, were they here today?",
  "- ...i should be friends with your friends. - okay, great.",
  "great. well, then, why don't you go get her?",
  "- you wanted to meet my friends. - sure.",
  "- i think i'm starting to get this. - really?",
  "come to the games. watch the games.",
  "please, i'm asking you as a friend.",
  "buying me something pretty isn't gonna make our problem just go away.",
  "look, i admit i haven't always been the best friend i could be.",
  "- stipulated. - and you do it all the time.",
  "we must not be playing it right.",
  "but we were never, like, going out.",
  "you know what? it is your life.",
  "in my apartment!",
  "you wouldn't want that, would you?",
  "take all the time you need.",
  "- do you want me to get it for you? - no.",
  "it'll take your mind off things.",
  "- ...she should've backed off. - like when a guy's upset...",
  "- i said i'm sorry. - sorry doesn't make up for the fact...",
  "this fighting, i might as well be back with my parents.",
  "- is that what you want? - of course not. i'll have my usual.",
  "oh, darling, don't you think- just this once?",
  "like what? yeah, yeah, i see you.",
  "it doesn't matter why he told me. it's true, isn't it?",
  "okay, yeah, it's true. but i can live with that stuff.",
  "that isn't even your problem. problem is you don't trust me.",
  "really? why not? you're so smart and i'm so dumb!",
  "i said, i'm busy, but that wasn't good enough for you!",
  "well, if it's a home invader, don't tell them i'm on the toilet!",
  "but then the next thing i know,",
  "but no matter what happens between us, we will always love you.",
  "i should have asked for much more than a comic book and a robot.",
  "- can you drive me? - i don't drive.",
  "- all right. can we go? - one moment.",
  "we never meant for it to happen.",
  "could you please drive a little faster?",
  "will you shut up? we're all hungry.",
  "bet you never thought i'd say that. ha-ha-ha.",
  "where do you think this is going?",
  "call me when you figure it out.",
  "did either of you guys",
  "...for depriving me of the opportunity to share my news with my friends.",
  "you are such a stupid idiot.",
  "i'm sorry you had to hear that...",
  "all right, these are the talking points for my npr interview tomorrow.",
  "in fact, it's better if you don't speak at all, peregrin took.",
  "...and i'm not sure she's my type.",
  "i am here, right? you see me?",
  "you asked me to think about where our relationship was going...",
  "that was our relationship.",
  "if you'd like to see the look on your stupid face...",
  "you want me to put it back?",
  "oh, while we're at it,",
  "he can still talk.",
  "perhaps there's hope for you after all.",
  "- where'd you get them? - shoes for less.",
  "my mother was right. hell is real.",
  "wow, you really are a piece of work.",
  "so we can see that ma equals mg and what do we know from this?",
  "and to answer it, we first must ask ourselves, what is physics?",
  "what was i supposed to do, tell her she has to spend christmas by herself?",
  "why were you keeping this a secret?",
  "- oh, i don't drink. - i do. i'll teach you.",
  "no, that's not going to work at all. i'll comfort you from over here.",
  "i don't understand. what other kind of women are there?",
  "no, it would just freak him out.",
  "good job not making fun of her.",
  "right, and if you can't understand it, it's not a fact.",
  "i don't like to kiss and tell, but somebody made it to eighth base.",
  "- i don't get it. you had a great time. - yes, exactly. i had a great time.",
  "don't worry, it's not you. i could never be mad at you.",
  "listen, they're kind of getting busy in the living room...",
  "how is that going to help you?",
  "what are we supposed to do now?",
  "yes, we are. and we're about to go to bed.",
  "i'll take the first watch.",
  "- where are you going? - just gonna take a look around outside.",
  "where did you get all this stuff?",
  "our security system tried to kill me.",
  "...so the mother ship can find you when it returns?",
  "i'm going to miss you.",
  "no, i'm going to count to three. one, two, three.",
  "how did you get into this place?",
  "if you don't come out of there, i'm gonna have to drag you out.",
  "well, that didn't work out, did it?",
  "we're gonna have to break up.",
  "sheldon, wait. this isn't even what i do. i'm a waitress, not a busboy.",
  "how long can he keep this up?",
  "i've been looking at it all wrong.",
  "who's going to clean all this up?",
  "homer, i'd be lying if i said...",
  "since i was six.",
  "there's also...",
  "i know what'll cheer you up. let's play one of your driving games.",
  "can't you at least try to understand how much this means to me?",
  "- so, what did you end up doing? - not much. nuked a burrito...",
  "after breakfast, i thought we could spend the day...",
  "i believe you know why i'm here.",
  "even though i don't have a girlfriend, i can still have a good time on valentine's.",
  "oh, my goodness, look at this room.",
  "i don't want to know that.",
  "of course i do. you're an important part of my life...",
  "i'm not going to pay a fine. that would imply i'm guilty.",
  "of course you have a choice.",
  "- oh, hey, buddy. how'd it go? - you know very well how it went.",
  "okay, that's enough, howard. the poor guy's had a tough time.",
  "but i can't give it to you.",
  "just a guy. i know a guy.",
  "that's okay. lots of people are.",
  "he's not saying it's a magic ring.",
  "how much is something like this worth?",
  "clearly, you've never been to my house for dinner on rosh hashanah.",
  "it was sitting on the table. anyone could've taken it.",
  "i found it. the ring is mine.",
  "my client's prepared to surrender any interest in the ring...",
  "- let me go. - i'm not letting you go!",
  "no, he doesn't. he's lying to you.",
  "i know all about these things.",
  "why don't we go after your mother?",
  "you quit the game. you had no right to take it.",
  "really? is that what you want",
  "...in the real world.",
  "i'm not sure what to do.",
  "what you can't do is shut up.",
  "what to you is a large crowd?",
  "even now i can remember that moment...",
  "no, no, no. you don't need to start singing it.",
  "and yet you can't speak to women.",
  "close your eyes, you'll get a surprise.",
  "- i'm not going to punch you. - that's what my sister used to say.",
  "would it be helpful to you if i told you about my dreams?",
  "i was wearing size a million pants.",
  "if it will help speed things along...",
  "and how did that make you feel?",
  "and my mother could've told me before...",
  "damn right, i'm angry with my mother.",
  "wait, that's it? i thought we had a whole hour.",
  "...and makes them grow. but my mother didn't hear me.",
  "...i would have tried a lot harder.",
  "we... yeah, we probably should go to sleep.",
  "i know where my feet have been.",
  "hey, man, i just wanted to tell you",
  "no reason. just glad to hear...",
  "okay, so what do you want to say?",
  "...and you said, thank you. good night.",
  "this is supposed to make me feel better?",
  "you want me to remove him from the team? i'm the captain, i can do that.",
  "well, if he does,",
  "well, we could if it were true.",
  "you live in the same building. you see each other all the time.",
  "don't you have a girlfriend?",
  "- hold on. i'll walk down with you. - oh, that's not necessary.",
  "oh, i believe that was something else i wasn't supposed to mention.",
  "look at this. do you think she's really doing that or is it photoshop?",
  "or how i lost my hot dogs.",
  "so we're bound to run into each other.",
  "you may as well get used to it.",
  "oh, well, then you do it.",
  "okay, then you can take him for shoes.",
  "i don't want to sit by you.",
  "- you're on your own. - see you, buddy.",
  "so you're saying the two of you are going to be sleeping in the same bed?",
  "all right, i believe i have time for one more question.",
  "when can i sit with you again?",
  "whoa! whoa! whoa! whoa, man!",
  "i want her to feel at home.",
  "you're having a woman stay with you?",
  "so nice to finally meet you in person.",
  "well, not my best friends. but i know them.",
  "if anyone should offer her anything, it should be me.",
  "let me show you to your room.",
  "let me just get one thing.",
  "but it's been a while now.",
  "okay, well, i guess i should get dressed so i can take everyone to work.",
  "because, boy, i was up all night.",
  "no, i was awake all night.",
  "i'm going to go change into something more comfortable.",
  "i was waiting for the right time...",
  "i don't have to go to hell. at 73 degrees, i'm there already.",
  "just like i was seven years ago.",
  "are you asking me or telling me?",
  "- a car. - and you'd be willing to drive me?",
  "okay, i suppose i could drive you.",
  "that's in my favor.",
  "- well, what's a point in my favor, right? - why don't you let me do this?",
  "it was the best apartment i'd seen, the rent was very reasonable...",
  "there was no place for company.",
  "i don't like this spot. i have to keep turning my head.",
  "- you're not going with us. - why not?",
  "so why was it his lucky day?",
  "joyce kim was curious about what i did for a living...",
  "you don't see your mistake, do you?",
  "what were you doing seven years ago?",
  "excuse me, i was in high school. studying, keeping my nose clean...",
  "anyway, i may owe you an apology.",
  "one of my best, don't you think?",
  "screw you, guys. i'm gonna go see if she's home.",
  "let me explain what we're doing here.",
  "how could somebody possibly think we're going to blow up the moon?",
  "- ...to be seen by the naked eye. - naked. heh, heh, heh.",
  "two-point-five seconds for the light to return. that's the moon. we hit the moon.",
  "i'm telling you, dude...",
  "can we just forget it ever happened?",
  "- since when? - i'll show you a picture...",
  "do you know what he's talking about?",
  "i know. it's been a while.",
  "do you, uh...want to lose again?",
  "...while the rest of it is wondering why i'm having this conversation with you.",
  "...how would you prefer i do it? the standard i told you so?",
  "with a woman you used to love",
  "i mean, what is wrong with me?",
  "somewhere where no one's seen me naked.",
  "what's going on? what do you want?",
  "but i can't deal with the fact",
  "no, i can't let you do that.",
  "and made a huge mistake last night.",
  "of course i won't. no, i won't.",
  "cool. can i say it fell apart",
  "and that's what we're going to be.",
  "you don't know the half of it.",
  "but if you did, you'd open yourself",
  "if we were an old married couple,",
  "not easy, but we're making it work.",
  "this is my sister you're talking about.",
  "oh, come on, tell me i'm wrong.",
  "name one time i've ever done that.",
  "so, how are your mom and dad?",
  "i didn't even think of that. thanks.",
  "you're welcome. please let me know when",
  "would you like to hear me play",
  "you know, maybe you should just go.",
  "i'm, uh, i'm sitting in your chair.",
  "and i'm gonna make you feel things",
  "if i may also say your name.",
  "thank you all for this high honor.",
  "it's okay if he wants to come.",
  "let's play a fun guessing game to see who gets to take me.",
  "now i'm thinking about what i read.",
  "- which side do you come down on? - i'll let you know after tonight.",
  "that's a pretty big word for a man-whore.",
  "well, don't think of it that way.",
  "why not? it's a great house, plenty of room.",
  "i'm not gonna live with your mother. not now, not ever.",
  "any decision we make, we will certainly make together.",
  "all these years, i've been so wrong.",
  "- there we go, last floor. - i just can't figure out what happened.",
  "sounds like you had a great night.",
  "- what do you mean by that? - it turns out she really knows...",
  "your mom and i made you breakfast.",
  "by the by, i liked it too.",
  "great. spent five hours last night at macy's registering for gifts.",
  "looks like i'm going to have to squint.",
  "- isn't that a little on the nose? - when you play chutes and ladders...",
  "oh, poor guy. he's so lonely. we should set him up with someone.",
  "yes, i've decided.",
  "she says, it's nice to meet you.",
  "play it cool, play it cool. okay, okay, sorry.",
  "huh. look at that. i have a date.",
  "okay. as soon as she gets here, so she knows i'm cool with it...",
  "- then spell it. - i don't know how to spell it.",
  "great. then she won't know i'm lying.",
  "you really wanna ask her that?",
  "when i was six years old,",
  "- is raj out with emily again? - yeah. every night for the last month.",
  "wow. i can't believe he has a girlfriend.",
  "yeah, yeah. i'm a gynecologist. i know exactly what she gives you.",
  "sometimes i put the tv on mute just to pretend she's still with me.",
  "mm, oh, cheesecake, you're just as good as a woman...",
  "here you go, boys. i'll pick it up when you're ready.",
  "so what do you want to do?",
  "- got it. can i have my water? - yeah, of course.",
  "...it's either dead or alive or both.",
  "i can't believe you signed this contract.",
  "what makes the right stuff so right is that it always comes home.",
  "would you like to see the invitation list?",
  "i'm still mad but i'll do it.",
  "i don't want to be the person in these journals anymore.",
  "...and turned my own mother against me.",
  "i don't know. if we're going to get back together, she's gonna have to apologize...",
  "am i the bad guy in this?",
  "- can we talk? - you can. i have nothing to say.",
  "and you come to my birthday party.",
  "it's called the born again boat ride.",
  "oh, that's a funny turn, isn't it?",
  "figure out if you're in a relationship or if you're just calling it one. like they say:",
  "hey look who decided to show up.",
  "okay, so i'll call you, and yeah, that'll be good.",
  "and what do we do it with?",
  "...but there's a lock for every key.",
  "nice. kick a man when he's down.",
  "leonard has a new girlfriend. how are you doing with all that?",
  "nope. she says if i don't back out, she's gonna go on a hunger strike.",
  "...but it's free to look upon those who do with righteous condemnation.",
  "falling on the head of the brilliant and the unremarkable alike.",
  "you and i, in so many ways...",
  "i know, it filled in last year.",
  "well, i know, but he means well.",
  "what are you trying to pull, mom?",
  "i don't know. she might be lost.",
  "you're going on the wall, my friend.",
  "you're kidding. you have your own book?",
  "- so, what's up? - okay, we used to go out, right?",
  "...who's about to be force-fed wine and cheese if he doesn't get to the point.",
  "i met this girl and she's great. we have a lot in common.",
  "- did you guys do it? - no. we just made out a little.",
  "oh, look at you, you bad boy.",
  "if you like this girl so much, just end things with priya.",
  "priya and i are in love. i think we could get married someday.",
  "- ...and have everybody be happy about it. - now we're getting somewhere.",
  "allow me to say, job well done.",
  "okay, well, see you. i'm going out.",
  "i'm supposed to go see that girl from the comic book store, alice.",
  "...you regret the stuff you didn't do more than the stuff that you did.",
  "well, i thought he made that up.",
  "- but? - but i kind of have a girlfriend.",
  "me? no, no, no, no. you must have it wrong.",
  "oh, yeah, it is and you won.",
  "well, if you don't mind looking like an orange traffic cone, great.",
  "hmm. i was hoping you wouldn't notice.",
  "okay, that time, you looked at me.",
  "please, we're eating. can we get that off the table and change the subject?",
  "i don't know, four or five years.",
  "we said we'd get more fresh air.",
  "okay. you know, i heard in the news...",
  "- where are you going? - i'm single. i don't need this crap.",
  "would you like to talk about it?",
  "you guys have nothing to worry about.",
  "well, uh, we just wanted to apologize...",
  "one of these things should die alone.",
  "i'm sorry, i bet my sweet what?",
  "well, all right. we're on our way.",
  "we're just trying on dresses. do we really need to record this?",
  "i was talking to the bird.",
  "so while we were going out, how often would you pretend...",
  "the question you should be asking is, what is their problem with me?",
  "no, i love them. i save them for the end, but they're gone because you ate them.",
  "maybe i'm not done hanging out...",
  "how could he do this to me?",
  "it's great. i've met some really nice people.",
  "you know, you just have to remember stuff that happened...",
  "what are you gonna do? doesn't he know you have a boyfriend?",
  "if it's not going anywhere, what does it hurt to look around?",
  "i think you need to ask yourselves who's really being ridiculous here.",
  "of our relationship.",
  "how did you get into my apartment?",
  "...here and after known as the boyfriend...",
  "you have to take care of it.",
  "...and you spent your whole christmas break waiting for it to come back down?",
  "could be up there someday.",
  "- oh, that's awful. - worst part was it was too big.",
  "- hey, buffy. - we're here to support you. bravo.",

  "why are you calling me here at home?",
  "you will do no such thing.",
  "...you aren't the least bit familiar with any of the equipment.",
  "do you know who that was?",
  "...if the cafeteria necessarily qualifies as being part of the hospital.",
  "it's in the same building. it's all under the same roof.",
  "knowing that you may never wake up again.",
  "...a few extra minutes in the car with my family?",
  "...but as i say, it's really too soon to tell.",

  "yeah, that was for your partner. it's privileges of seniority and all.",
  "free licence to bitch and moan. how often do you get that?",
  "not that it matters. but... it matters.",
  "just like a... like a box, you know, to put stuff in.",
  "...he looked at it and said:",
  "at first i thought to myself, hell yeah, bitch.",
  "he was just asking me honestly, is that all you got?",
  "yeah, man, i can do better, so i started from scratch.",
  "i've got to get back. i've got to try.",
  "i just... i want to see how you're holding up.",
  "hi. is this a bad time, or...",
  "no, no, thanks. i'm just on my way home.",
  "i just wish there was something more that we could do.",

  "so all this is to say we have the money.",
  "i mean, literally. it's so gross.",
  "so how far off are we?",
  "stop acting like such a baby.",
  "mr. white, talk to me here.",
  "hey, what happened to your head?",
  "will you just please focus on...?",
  "have i been speaking to myself?",

  "look, i definitely got it, man, all ri...",
  "we need to destroy the stone now.",
  "all right? i'm on board.",
  "but it turned out that the cancer had spread to her brain...",
  "none of this makes any sense.",
  "...that would explain all of this, but with her, i just...",
  "i said that. but it was just an excuse.",
  "actually, that was the night i brought you your money, remember?",
  "i mean, think of the odds of me going in, sitting down...",
  "you understand? and if they ever found out...",
  "you know, i don't get it.",
  "...until that stupid door was perfect.",
  "you're sure you can do this?",
  "this is bullshit. just say it.",
  "honestly? i don't wanna be here.",
  "- oh, hey, sorry. - no, go ahead.",
  "well, i think that this is...",
  "yes. my guy is a top...",
  "and it is. it will be.",
  "i can't get caught using again.",
  "what if i could get some?",
  "it's a story people will believe.",
  "and we don't talk about him.",
  "people will believe it, at least.",
  "i worked here for four years.",
  "what do you know about me?",
  "who did he say he killed?",
  "why did you invite me here?",
  "more than i care to admit.",
  "to be poor, anyone can manage.",
  "never make the same mistake twice.",
  "i heard you were the man.",
  "it's new every time. each time is a different experience.",
  "come on, it's supposed to hurt. pain is weakness leaving your body.",
  "all right. i'll be right back.",
  "...that i have to move forward. always good advice, at least for me.",
  "all right, fair enough. who else had their hand up?",
  "so both of you start thinking about what kind of car you wanna buy me.",
  "there's so much we need to talk about.",
  "- no, aria. - yeah, but how do i know that?",
  "uh, yes, i do.",
  "let me bottom line this for you. you don't need to be involved, okay?",
  "i'm cleaned out of anything else.",
  "um, i thought that you had a meeting tonight.",
  "brandon, peter. how goes it? hanging in there?",
  "you can't get your nut up to sell, what's the point of even coming?",
  "...and every time, i drive away smelling like an alpine whorehouse.",
  "you want to stay for dinner?",
  "i take care of my baby. i'll do anything for him.",
  "now, while i agree with you that laser tag is a hard sell...",
  "well, when i first started out, i made a lot of mistakes.",
  "-what the hell are you doing? -what the hell are you doing?",
  "hear how i just said kid?",
  "- oh, my god. - look, these two...",
  "hey. you got a kid, right?",
  "and, of course, he got quiet...",
  "i'll never make that mistake again.",
  "i don't know. they're always around.",
  "besides, what if someone comes in?",
  "this is just sad. i mean...",
  "we're thinking maybe a car wash.",
  "what do you mean? like the...?",
  "i'm sorry. i'm sorry. i have to go.",
  "...but once i get my provisional, i can keep working at it.",
  "- thanks. - see you, dad.",
  "- bye, son. hey, good work today. - thank you.",
  "why would your estranged husband be doing all this for you?",
  "they all got to go!",
  "this is a ridiculous idea.",
  "it was a good plan back when it was tuco, and it's a good plan now.",
  "okay, let me explain the difference between you and me.",
  "track them down.",
  "because back then, you were too busy getting high, feeling sorry.",
  "yeah. that's exactly what i'm saying. $2,500 apiece.",
  "he promised me he'd be here by noon !",
  "no, no. it's not about money.",
  "and you can never talk to anyone, right?",
  "i'm not going to do it.",
  "this is a professional courtesy. no one knows i'm here. understand?",
  "and if pinkman were arrested, he'd take it as a problem.",
  "but there was one guy, one guy.",
  "so instead of left, i go right, out into nowhere.",
  "i don't get this at all.",
  "i don't get this at all. all i'm seeing is the kid.",
  "if it wasn't for this man here.",
  "this is what happens now. my men will come back inside...",
  "...and you will shake their hands and you will make peace.",
  "you okay with this? you got anything to say here?",
  "just lying in a hospital bed getting sponge baths from nurses.",
  "it's a waste of time.",
  "i hope we're not too late.",
  "let's see how this goes first.",
  "not that i know of, no.",
  "i would never ask you that!",
  "...it's what i do, after all.",
  "hey, lady, are you still there? ask her if she's still there.",
  "- all right, let's close it up. - whoa!",
  "it is why he does this, to provide for his family, which he's accomplished.",
  "they will never want for anything, he's seen to that.",
  "that is very much the question.",
  "you don't think you're ready now?",
  "...we both know why, don't we?",
  "because you know it's the right thing to do.",
  "where else are you gonna find scoops of flesh?",
  "i got my old job back.",
  "how long you think you've got?",
  "...listening to every word i say.",
  "he's not in the phone book, i can't find him on the internet...",
  "make it look like an accident.",
  "please, tell me you found him.",
  "no. looks pretty much wide-open.",
  "when are you gonna do it?",
  "come on, get in the car.",
  "i'll take you right to him.",
  "and it's gonna have to be, you know--",
  "you might want to hold off on that--",
  "i got a lot of money",
  "i can't do it, mr. white.",
  "i can't do it. i'm sorry.",
  "hi. how can i help you?",
  "that goes for all of it.",
  "maybe even a touch beyond that.",
  "please, don't let this trouble you.",
  "i came out of my apartment. a couple came out.",
  "i don't think they saw anybody.",
  "it was just this one loud... this very loud pop and that was all.",
  "then it's straight residential. you want me to what? yeah.",
  "no. i'll stay on the line.",
  "- don't touch anything. - don't touch anything.",
  "no, no, no, it's okay. i needed to get up anyway.",
  "all right, all right. what do you want?",
  "what the hell does she want?",
  "anything at all? please, i'm looking for some help here.",
  "- sir, again, thank you so much. really. - yeah.",
  "i heard it was very good.",
  "he didn't deserve it at all.",
  "but i'd shoot him again tomorrow and the next day and the day after that.",
  "and what happens in the summer when the humidity rises...",
  "how would you guard against that, huh?",
  "you kill me, you have nothing.",
  "you can't afford to do this.",
  "let us work. we're ready to go to work.",
  "put him in feet first. grab his shoe.",
  "you'd think he would have seen it.",
  "-sure, but, uh-- -but what?",
  "really? oh, so please tell me.",
  "...well, it might could be him keeping the peace instead of you.",
  "- have a piece of onion instead. - sagdiyev.",
  "all this to say, i'm happy to take your money.",
  "fair point, i guess.",
  "okay, walt, could you call me back, please?",
  "- car wash. - car wash!",
  "hey, pop, i'm going to work now.",
  "right on. least we can do.",
  "because the way we left things, i would like the chance to clear the air.",
  "yeah, that's good. drink that up.",
  "damn straight i'm alive.",
  "guess you know i've been calling.",
  "you got other things going on. i get it.",
  "any other advice for me? because i am serious about this.",
  "i have worked 30 years on building this business from nothing...",
  "...perhaps eight-figure cash settlement that i can win for you...",
  "may i buy you a drink?",
  "there were some actions that i took which i want you to understand.",
  "i hope you can appreciate that.",
  "i was thinking, like, next week?",
  "can we talk about this later?",
  "yeah, so if you could just please leave before i get angry",
  "you keep saying that word. danger. danger.",
  "and now you're telling me ...",
  "and i just think that in the end...",
  "whole lot of natural light.",
  "i just want to make sure,",
  "if you know what i mean.",
  "and i don't need you no more",
  "not your birthday. well, i'm just saying, you know,",

  "stuff. ha, ha, ha.",
  "i mean, i mean, there's got to be",
  "and i do not want to be like him. ever.",
  "to do your business for you. ha, ha.",
  "isn't anybody going to go on record?",
  "you know, maybe they were thinking, someday.",
  "what a fascinating career that must have been for him.",
  "downtown, but we were almost never there.",
  "you better just back off, okay?",
  "- let go of my purse! - not until the police get here.",
  "come on in, grab a seat.",
  "yeah, just throw that stuff anywhere.",
  "thanks again for the other day. you know, this whole thing, it's, uh...",
  "yeah, it looks like it.",
  "you ever come across a guy by the name of gale boetticher?",
  "but what good does that do me?",
  "if you could just take a look, tell me what i got here.",
  "well, it was a good try.",
  "well, i understand that you're disappointed, but that is my final offer.",
  "because l want to pay less.",
  "yeah, but that's the very reason we need to negotiate.",
  "well, he's not calling you back.",
  "dude, it's been six months. it's time to move on, okay?",
  "it's definitely happening to you.",
  "i told you we'd get it.",
  "it was really great work.",
  "well, yes, he found the guy, but l told him what to do and what to say.",
  "you're right. that's the hard part.",
  "how much did you pay for it?",
  "and that's not the point. the point is we're broke, remember?",
  "i'm asking you to be smart.",
  "and when l look at this image that is part of the record,",
  "all those in favor, raise your hand and say yes. yes.",
  "me, my family, everything l loved.",
  "all right, i'll see you soon.",
  "taking too long.",
  "okay, let's see what i got.",
  "i've, uh-- i've got a lot of, uh, luggage here.",
  "we can hand off so we don't leave anything out, and it'll seem natural.",
  "it'll seem suspicious.",
  "gambling became an addiction and i just couldn't control it.",
  "so after you say how very sorry you are, in your own words, of course,",
  "i said, i don't know. maybe. when you dab your eyes,",
  "uh, it's just a little something.",
  "exactly. whatever the hell he said. heh, heh. anyway, you, uh, get the idea.",
  "you got to check this out.",
  "dad, you're such a stud. how much did you win exactly?",
  "same goes for me, you know. if you ever wanna bounce anything off me,",
  "i mean, we're not talking about kickball",
  "yeah. yeah. that's pretty rare these days,",
  "hey, man, let me see that.",
  "and from time to time",
  "what the hell? what is wrong with this?",
  "we done here? no, we are not done here.",

  "tell me exactly what happened from the moment you got there.",
  "no, i need to know specifics. now, we'll start from the beginning.",
  "you drove there. you drove over there. you went to his door, right?",
  "did you walk into the room or did you shoot him right then and there?",
  "if they had anything on him, he'd be locked up already.",
  "should i not worry that gus plans to murder me at the first chance he gets?",
  "why am i the only person",
  "i mean, there's no coming back.",
  "it's gonna fuck with your bone marrow and it's gonna mess up...",
  "all right. i can get them.",
  "you know what's next'? huh?",
  "you know how come i know?",
  "you went to all this trouble.",
  "i'm sorry to keep you waiting.",
  "- hmm. - something's got to be done.",
  "may i ask where we're going?",
  "shut up and listen to me.",
  "just make sure she gets everything. all right? just make it happen.",
  "that i was thinking about what you said.",
  "would you like to try?",
  "you just go in the back and you tell him it's walter white. understand?",
  "what you told mr. white, that's...",
  "i'd like to finish before dark.",
  "any names i should check out?",
  "he and i have a history.",
  "uh... i would have to say...",
  "you don't need to do that.",
  "how does that even make sense?",
  "look, i just do what i'm told, man.",
  "if we don't do this right -",
  "we will be fine. believe it.",
  "if we're going to do this,",
  "think maybe you'll be free?",
  "we'll be out in a minute.",
  "oh, this is going to make fascinating reading.",
  "maybe you should move back in.",
  "i need him. you people have me down here...",
  "that's just one of the many men my mom's juggling.",
  "this is it, right? last stop?",
  "there you go, peter. one for you, two for me.",
  "okay, i didn't have a choice.",
  "it's cool to be back home.",
  "it was just like wife beaters... anyway, it was...",
  "they're making a grab, i hear.",
  "so, what are you gonna do with holly? you can't take her to work...",
  "you know, i... i just think that, uh...",
  "i mean, we're talking five stars. candles and white tablecloth.",
  "i don't know. something good.",
  "or something like that, you know.",
  "...not to tell you your business, but i'm not sure i agree.",
  "you shouldn't have let me sleep.",
  "that it might not be this boetticher after all.",
  "and i was up all night and i became addicted.",
  "and then i remembered the message you left me the other day...",
  "...when you said you loved me.",
  "i think that message was some kind of goodbye.",
  "do you know what would happen",
  "and i'm flattered that you would think of me...",
  "and where is your pretty wife?",
  "well, like i say to her, place sells as is. understand?",
  "being in charge is not easy.",
  "and not everyone knows this.",
  "boss has to be tough.",
  "has to say no to people.",
  "...even if they don't want to.",
  "what did she say, exactly?",
  "no, it's not that. it's not that at all.",
  "but that's what you said. that what you said men say.",
  "like backup, like a second set of eyes. everybody needs backup, right?",
  "and this has to be you?",
  "it can't be, i don't know, tyrus or any of the couple dozen muscle-heads...",
  "why? what, is there something about you that i don't know?",
  "i see this thing probably started as gus getting mike to babysit me.",
  "because the way you describe it, they gave up pretty damn easy.",
  "no, no, this whole thing, all of this...",
  "who is-- hang on--",
  "then we ask a few questions and get our property back.",
  "- there's something in there i need. - and what would that be?",
  "yeah? how do you know that?",
  "yeah, tucker needs to learn to keep his damn mouth shut.",
  "you going to help me out here?",
  "give us a minute, will you?",
  "i hear you can handle yourself.",
  "yeah. dad got it for me.",
  "well, that was very nice of him.",
  "...well, awesome, but it's super safe.",
  "look, about that, it just...",
  "i want you to know something.",
  "but he had what he needed.",
  "someone has to protect this family...",
  "did they talk to lan?",
  "- look at all this damn water. - don't drink that.",
  "call me if there's a problem",
  "no, i'm sure he'll see me.",
  "but you can get it in a can, yes,",
  "i'm sorry, did i wake you?",
  "all that's left is to wait.",
  "you talking about a hit man?",
  "doing this kind of work,",
  "why don't you ask your partner?",
  "and every time we go there...",
  "how close were you to him?",
  "what about this girlfriend of yours",
  "you know what? he's doing better.",
  "oh, yeah. very important stuff.",
  "so it's more than you thought,",
  "and this is somehow bad news?",
  "i can't go to the bank with it. i sure can't leave it here.",
  "i thought that you had this under control.",
  "i never wanted any of this.",
  "making it in his own lab seemed appropriate.",
  "this is still the best way.",
  "a man his age, working as hard as he does,",
  "seriously, how does that happen?",
  "and then there would have been no trouble today.",
  "can i get you anything else?",
  "you know how to make coffee?",
  "three guys up at the gate, two visible, one in the blind.",
  "i don't wanna see that in your hand unless you see me with mine.",
  "we're just going to get started, we're going to figure this out.",
  "i think i'll have a hit.",
  "anything you want to talk about?",
  "you hit it with your car?",
  "and he was scared. and then something...",
  "no. he was just, like, uh...",
  "so no matter what i do,",
  "- how you doing? - well, he's doing fine, george.",
  "let's go, we're running late. come on.",
  "hey, better you than me, buddy.",
  "or whatever the hell that is.",
  "- this cow screaming is so loud. - so loud.",
  "i'm still pretty new at this.",
  "that's what they keep telling me.",
  "until then, you're in charge.",
  "that's how i live my life.",
  "- well, should we get started? - yeah.",
  "- i'd like to record this conversation. - of course.",
  "so after years with no contact, he shows up in your restaurant...",
  "uh, peg, there's just one other thing.",
  "well, like you said, he's a- this man is a big law enforcement booster.",
  "there's lots of closet space.",
  "we're not here for the chicken.",
  "stick this on...",
  "you're walking past the car...",
  "- so where do we stand? - where do we stand on what?",
  "you didn't lose it, did you? you would tell me if you lost it, right?",
  "if he didn't see me coming like he's some kind of...",
  "- ah, i got it. - yeah.",
  "so you haven't even seen him since that time at the diner?",
  "well, he's not going to just tell me.",
  "i'll kill him! i'll kill him!",
  "- you got to stay. - no, you can go.",

  "you know that i won't lie",
  "look around for things. and, yeah.",
  "not at all. you look happy.",
  "how long have you had this?",
  "so is he gonna kill him?",
  "who really cares what l think?",
  "should i even ask? i wouldn't.",
  "and if you ever plan on calling the cops on one of my guys again,",
  "what the hell was he doing?",
  "his distribution network. they're not looking to kill him.",
  "which i hate, because l'm a real-paper person.",
  "prepared food so we could sit and talk.",
  "i need you to answer one question for me.",
  "okay, so word has come down that they--",
  "that was yesterday, you know?",
  "anyway, they've been holding them off.",
  "look, i didn't have a chance, all right?",
  "i knew you would freak out and wouldn't believe me.",
  "that's why i didn't say anything.",
  "you had one thing to do, one thing.",
  "this. this is how l knew.",
  "i forgot to get the paper. can you grab it for me?",
  "it's from me and your dad. it's pretty slick, huh?",
  "and, of course, it is safe because i'm still your mother.",
  "i am your mother.",
  "well, maybe this is good news.",
  "but having passed... my condolences. ...you are the next in line...",
  "so you understand what asshole means.",
  "who do you think you are?",
  "to show you how it's done.",
  "what do you mean, a fight? like...? what fight?",
  "just do not call your mother.",
  "why would you do that for me?",
  "i don't understand. how'd you get into a fight?",
  "all right, what's the problem?",
  "...and let's just say...",
  "- three hours after leaving my office. - he bought a mercedes sl550.",
  "...and i made the brilliant decision...",
  "...can't think of me like...",
  "i knew things about my father.",
  "i had a lot of information.",
  "and i always pretended that was who i saw too.",
  "anyway, there lying on the bed...",
  "and he's looking right at me...",
  "like there was nothing in him.",

  "oh, don't worry. the only thing",
  "oh, my god! you found it!",
  "best of all, i fixed this!",
  "it's working! how'd you do that?",
  "now follow your big, weird heart.",
  "you're the worst family in history,",
  "hey! so we have good news",
  "what are you trying to say?",
  "i could pull the ring off,",
  "that's fine. i just won't look",

  "that's all i wanted to say.",
  "i want to ask you something.",

  "first i was a little upset,",
  "he should already think you're great.",
  "here's what we know so far:",
  "not on the night in question.",
  "so just tell us the answer.",
  "do you have the answer yet?",
  "no, don't do that, all right?",
  "don't let him off the hook.",
  "so, what do we do now?",
  "there's something i got to do.",
  "also i'm taking your captain hat",
  "just say you're a captain now,",
  "or we can all work together",
  "yeah, well, maybe not at first.",
  "my power went out last night,",
  "and my alarm didn't go off.",
  "you brought this on yourself, son.",
  "but i'm here, ready to go.",
  "my car ran out of gas,",
  "i told her we were there.",
  "guys, this is not my fault.",
  "we have to do our job.",
  "nothing is made to be broken.",
  "if you guys won't help me,",
  "i'm putting an end to this.",
  "i'm sorry we missed the show.",
  "i just broke into your car",
  "you didn't even know a man",
  "that no one is after you.",
  "just let us take you home.",
  "and you know what happened then?",
  "this is how i move now.",
  "walking is too close to dancing,",
  "she usually doesn't care at all",
  "maybe not with most people, captain.",
  "but she cares what you think.",
  "i've lost track of your point.",
  "you were gone for three hours.",
  "and why would i do that?",
  "wait, no, i didn't decide that.",
  "decided to take my own life.",
  "you know, i should write more.",
  "i know what that feels like.",
  "really? you're not gonna kill me?",
  "wait. wait. how did you find me?",
  "so we knew something was wrong.",
  "come on, captain. i need this.",
  "if this will make you happy...",
  "i believe these belong to you.",
  "it doesn't have to be perfect.",
  "my birthday wish finally came true!",
  "but your words are real sad.",
  "did he clear you or not?",
  "you don't need to be here.",
  "your fingers are really far apart.",
  "because i do not want this.",
  "no one would ever believe that.",
  "and everyone's making a huge deal",
  "- i promise you. - no, you're not.",
  "why would you even get involved",
  "i will not throw it out,",
  "but i will open a window",

  "you guys make some great points,",
  "i am right all the time.",
  "oh, i see. you heard me.",
  "you were just taken by surprise.",
  "they should be here by now.",
  "i got hit by a car.",
  "i'm done trying to help you.",
  "people got hurt because of me.",
  "you'll be no use to anyone.",
  "but right now, my body has",
  "it was a pretty fun night.",

  "because we are going to destroy",
  "not where i saw that going,",
  "what are you guys laughing at?",
  "great, but what's his body like",
  "sir, please let the record show",
  "that i plan to bring to...",
  "three heads are better than two.",
  "i think about that every day.",
  "he gave me the hard sell.",
  "- it's not just about me. - exactly.",
  "well, that is a horrible surprise.",
  "which means i'm here a lot.",
  "oh no. you don't order here.",
  "cool, when this case is over,",
  "ugh, just say you like her.",
  "but i wanted to ask you...",

  "i thought i was perfectly clear.",
  "i'm gonna go grab some coffee.",
  "hey, now that it's just us,",
  "there's a thing i wanted to...",
  "oh, no. i figured it out.",
  "who's proud of what he does.",
  "i've never been turned down before,",
  "yeah, i should ask her myself.",
  "if you break up with them,",
  "you got me with my thing.",
  "she's dancing even better than normal.",
  "oh, i don't know about that,",
  "i'm sorry. but i'm going to.",
  "and that's how it's going down.",
  "sir, we have to do something.",
  "but i was really laughing hard.",
  "well, i appreciate that you used",
  "but you're worried he's still into",

  "but these kids had fun today.",
  "no one's gone in our out.",
  "no, don't give him the nice.",
  "- what? - the body is right here.",
  "oh, man, look at the captain.",
  "oh, no, he's standing perfectly still.",
  "okay, i am. i'm gonna go.",

  "no, from now on, call me...",
  "thank you, guys, for helping me.",
  "yeah, everyone should listen to me",
  "sorry, i thought it looked cool.",
  "and it's always been my dream",
  "wait... why would you say that?",
  "captain, get in here with me.",
  "it's basically part of the force.",
  "let me just start by saying",
  "they're black now, but they're there.",
  "you can take her away now.",
  "that's something you think i said?",
  "all right, if it's not that,",
  "and now i totally get it.",
  "come in and shut the door.",
  "telling him it was a mistake.",

  "you are just so sweet together.",
  "thank you so much for waiting.",
  "- your table is almost ready. - great.",

  "we first met five years ago,",
  "but we don't count it, because...",
  "i don't have it on me.",
  "good luck on your wedding, guys.",
  "yeah, who cares about a kiss?",
  "he's pulling over. it's going down.",
  "i'm still super mad at you.",
  "and a cup of hot chocolate.",
  "that's exactly what i'm gonna get.",
  "this whole night was really weird.",
  "- what the hell? - i don't understand.",
  "and i will never forget it.",
  "i feel so bad for him.",
  "so how are you holding up?",
  "could probably just say it once.",
  "i have no use for people.",
  "i live my life by numbers.",
  "that i most certainly cannot keep.",
  "yeah, i'm having a heart attack.",
  "rule one, let's not tell anyone",
  "so should we go out tonight?",
  "how long could that possibly take?",
  "they've been at it for months.",
  "at some point in your life.",
  "and four for me as well.",
  "i hope it wasn't a mistake.",

  "well, thank you very much, sir,",
  "i'm just gonna look in here.",
  "oh, this is a heart attack.",
  "oh, i am over the moon.",
  "all right, so what is this?",
  "but it won't be the same.",
  "who knows who we're getting next?",
  "yeah, it's been a little more",
  "not a relationship you care about.",
  "that is not who you are.",
  "even if the only people listening",
  "i didn't do it for him.",
  "and together, we can do anything.",
  "but that's all in the past,",
  "i got serious money on it.",
  "by the end of the week.",
  "we came up with a plan.",
  "are trying to take me down.",
  "i would never break the rules.",
  "i forget all the other names.",

  "'cause you used to work here.",
  "i got to go find him.",
  "run my hands through my hair.",
  "you get to keep your job.",
  "i was looking for you inside.",
  "just trying to have a conversation.",
  "how did you know my husband?",

  "i don't care what you like.",
  "you're right. i couldn't help myself.",
  "i wanted to know about her.",
  "so go ahead. laugh at me!",
  "you need to leave right now.",
  "and none of them have worked.",
  "so what? we'll figure it out.",
  "we don't even know what it is yet. we don't know what it is.",
  "you find something you care about,",
  "we weren't together for very long.",
  "our relationship was only six days.",
  "i lost something important too, shoot.",
  "thought i might find you here.",
  "like her from the movie her.",
  "you should try to be happy.",
  "why do you have that thing?",
  "he's actually really scary up close.",
  "how many dogs do you have?",
  "three. that's how many i have.",
  "sure, i was hoping you'd ask.",
  "wow, this is a bad idea.",
  "well, you can count me out.",
  "oh, here she comes. oh, okay.",
  "something is off about the case.",
  "great news is, it doesn't matter,",
  "yeah, i'm too close to this.",
  "you can think of besides yourself",
  "- okay. - wait, give me a second.",
  "- could be. - yeah, check this out.",
  "we should probably leave this prison.",
  "it's more about the other things.",
  "because you don't deserve that memory.",
  "but he didn't do anything wrong.",
  "he's still in love with her.",
  "i want them out of here.",
  "- that's actually pretty good. - i know.",
  "that she didn't tell anyone about.",
  "just me and my five dogs.",
  "that's fine; i'll never have any.",
  "okay, let me just grab that.",
  "i'm off to the cheese shop...",
  "and i'm buying by the wheel.",
  "because she was busy getting busy.",
  "do you seriously not hear it,",
  "i did it to be amazing.",
  "didn't happen, and i should know.",
  "and guess what i'm getting him.",
  "do you know what this means?",
  "and throw them out the window?",
  "but these aren't bad for you.",
  "don't want to cause a problem.",
  "i'll take your word for it.",
  "hey, knock it off back there.",
  "seven times, once for every day",
  "how is he, by the way?",
  "well, he's not telling us anything,",
  "your hard work just paid off.",
  "none of them the same one,",
  "and that will never happen again.",
  "you know, the rest of you",
  "i'll make dinner once a week,",
  "how can i ever thank you?",
  "start taking care of yourself again.",
  "oh, i should probably also mention,",
  "to put him away for good.",
  "or was i never really gone?",
  "come on, our parents are married.",
  "because that's where the camera is.",
  "sir, do you have a minute?",
  "we all have the same weapons.",
  "but he should be back soon.",
  "all right, smile... three, two, one...",
  "of course it's still in there.",
  "no, no. it's about a crime.",
  "here, you can both have it.",
  "- i feel terrible. - we should apologize.",
  "i don't understand what is happening.",
  "no, you weren't part of this.",
  "so how'd you pull it off?",
  "now that i knew your plan,",
  "yeah. yeah, it was pretty cool.",
  "there's glass everywhere, and i say,",
  "who cares about one broken window?",
  "don't worry. it's gonna be fine.",
  "guess i should be getting back.",
  "okay, well, great to see you.",
  "it's just the three of us.",
  "no, thank you for being amazing",
  "what's up? how can i help?",
  "well, when i was a kid,",
  "but if we're gonna do this,",
  "and see what time it is.",
  "oh, but i wouldn't use it.",
  "don't do anything i wouldn't do.",
  "i think that went very well.",
  "now it's coming down. oh, boy!",
  "not too hard, late release, and...",
  "speaking of which, i'm getting hungry.",
  "did you not pack any food?",
  "okay, fine. we weren't making out.",
  "but i think it went well.",
  "at least there was no crying.",
  "how'd you end up down there?",
  "i was so scared, you guys.",
  "you have the right to remain...",
  "i'm sorry. i'm just not interested.",
  "okay. thank you for your time.",
  "you didn't bring food or water",
  "are not looking great right now,",
  "oh, guys, please, please calm down.",
  "with my best friend... my mom.",
  "oh, let me guess. dumb mistake.",
  "i want to apologize for yesterday.",
  "but he wanted to get married,",
  "then what if i'm never ready?",
  "if you have to explain it.",
  "but you still made a difference.",
  "- that's all i ask. - i won't.",
  "oh, this isn't gonna end well.",
  "no, i was up all night",
  "i didn't ask for part two.",
  "oh, you gonna love that stuff.",
  "oh. so what do you say?",
  "we could work the case together.",
  "oh, are you two no longer...",
  "you have nothing to worry about.",
  "are you so proud of me?",
  "don't you mean leave i alone?",
  "'cause that's where you do it.",
  "and i didn't think things through.",
  "for the rest of your life.",
  "sometimes, being as tough as possible",
  "come on. it's just a car.",
  "he's not gonna be that mad.",
  "do you feel that's the case?",
  "that is much too much money.",
  "yeah, and it was worth it.",
  "it just doesn't seem worth it.",
  "it would make him so happy.",
  "i bet it's a room number.",
  "well, there's no surprise in that.",
  "because it's very special to me,",
  "oh, my god. did that work?",
  "she looks as good as new.",
  "i'm gonna call my mom tonight.",

  "in fact, when i was young, my neighbor's chicken got loose...",
  "let me ask you one first.",
  "since i was eight years old.",
  "...while my wife was back home...",
  "not a lot. that we always have the option of going back to being friends.",
  "i mean, you have to admit...",
  "- it would take the pressure off. - it would, wouldn't it?",
  "so, what are you guys doing?",
  "i guess i could serve both.",
  "hard to believe, but go on.",

  "- you're going to have to listen to me. - listen to you? [laughs]",
  "then you leave me no choice.",
  "i'm not giving you the job.",
  "oh, god, how did he know?",
  "i should have seen that coming.",
  "i'll get out of your way.",
  "no, no. that rate is much too low from what we'd expect from this collision.",
  "well, let me tell you something.",
  "i said give it to me.",
  "all right, you've made your point.",
  "- don't ruin the game. - how could he ruin the game?",
  "...that person would have his girlfriend...",
  "so that's how it works.",
  "because i haven't figured out a way to bring it up.",
  "what am i supposed to say?",
  "half of it will be mine.",
  "wow, you really are a genius.",
  "speaking of what the heart wants, um...",
  "just as a favor to me?",
  "what did you tell her about me? did you mention body fat?",
  "- are you going to answer it? - i'm torn.",
  "we wouldn't want to miss that!",
  "my mother calls me at work to see if i had a healthy bowel movement.",
  "a catholic girl like you wearing a big cross like that...",
  "okay, but only if you come to sunday dinner at my house wearing a yarmulke.",
  "‐ she's very happy.",
  "no. no, i'm not. so, great.",
  "- maybe we'll hang out later? - no chance.",
  "- no, she didn't. - yes, she did.",
  "what was i supposed to do?",
  "you know, you always do this.",
  "good, good. hey, i'm glad to hear it. yeah.",
  "well, you know, i just noticed i haven't really met any of them.",
  "that's exactly what my father said.",
  "- i really appreciate this. - yeah, yeah.",
  "i brought you a little gift.",
  "- now we're back live. - okay, yeah.",
  "so, yeah, anyway, that's my boyfriend.",
  "...which i think we all know is a popular euphemism...",
  "and it's none of your business.",
  "what is he doing? what the hell is he doing?",
  "you think you're doing a favor by being in a relationship with me.",
  "- come on. we're late. - calm down. we'll make the movie.",
  "- we're, uh, going to the movies. - no, we're not.",
  "no. there's a difference between being and acting stupid.",
  "oh, yeah? well, there's a difference between being a jerk and being an ass.",
  "well, excuse me. i don't think penny's out of line. you don't own her.",
  "- don't bring my mother into this! - you brought your mother into this!",
  "boy, what got him so upset?",
  "or do i have to wait for someone else to order the other half?",
  "i am not going to apologize to you.",
  "okay, if leonard has problems with me, why hasn't he just said so?",
  "well, will you do me a favor then?",
  "can't you just say, i'm busy?",
  "- let it go, sheldon. - why should i let it go? i saw it first.",
  "and then we can all go home happy.",
  "okay, you can have that one.",
  "no one's saying that. let's go.",
  "- ...in case one is in an accident. - one was already in an accident.",
  "doesn't feel like an arm.",
  "then maybe you should let it go.",
  "up above the world so high",
  "i can feel the earth moving. heh.",
  "we have to fill these out.",
  "and she was my second cousin.",
  "no, i was just... because... never mind.",
  "and we both know what that means.",
  "you don't have to do it.",
  "- i know, but she's not you. - i'm not me.",
  "i hope that's all you're doing! we share that tub!",
  "how do you think i'm doing?",
  "come on, it wasn't that bad.",
  "i don't think that's possible.",
  "he'll sit down and it'll sound like he's flatulent even though he's not.",
  "come on. you hurt her feelings by not calling her all week.",
  "this will only take a second.",
  "i think it upsets sheldon when you play with the food.",
  "i hope it's all right, i told bernadette she could join us for dinner.",
  "oh, yeah, you can't sit there.",
  "that's not fair. i got stuck behind a tree.",
  "maybe you just need a little more practice.",
  "it's not about shoes, is it?",
  "i just want you to know that that's not enough.",
  "no. i want to surprise him.",
  "yeah, it was pretty cool.",
  "- boy, i'd love to see that. - you're welcome to come.",
  "all right. what is your deal?",
  "uh, i'm not... not interested.",
  "you know, if you liked that one, i got more.",
  "i didn't say anything like that.",
  "okay, i just have one question.",
  "he had a panic attack once when he got his head stuck in his sweater.",
  "what do you think, leonard? should i give him another chance?",
  "that's it. that's all i know.",
  "- no, really. i have a girlfriend now. - and where is she this evening?",
  "- tell her i have a girlfriend. - all right.",
  "he has a girlfriend {all gasp}",
  "there. it's late. now, go to bed.",
  "yes. i mean, actual women are the best.",
  "how did we get actual women?",
  "i don't want to do that.",
  "maybe you should look into that.",
  "there's just so many things",
  "dude, there are so many cool things we could be doing tonight. look.",
  "this is the place to be.",
  "we're gonna make out back here.",
  "- you help me run my game. - okay.",
  "in brightest day, in darkest night, no evil shall escape my sight.",
  "so, what should we talk about?",
  "well, we could always learn more...",
  "- would you like to try some? - yeah, sure.",
  "well, the fact is...",
  "i can come back later.",
  "it's just not really who i am.",
  "should we go down now and see what it's all about?",
  "oh, god. yes, we get it. you have a girlfriend now.",
  "so what? it's the same food.",
  "oh, is it? look at this.",
  "it doesn't mean any of that. it's a typo.",
  "the only thing we can do.",
  "oh, how i wish i could.",
  "it won't happen again. what's up?",
  "but you don't like other people.",
  "amy, how could you not get that?",
  "- what if they cut the power? - there's a 200-watt...",
  "so this money, he just gave it to you?",
  "oh, if that were only true.",
  "i sense you're making a joke, but bozeman does have...",
  "...and maudlin displays of emotion, so i've prepared a short video.",
  "...and maudlin displays of emotion, so i've prepared this short video.",
  "- yes. - then i've been up all night.",
  "maybe you need a fresh start.",
  "how long has he been stuck?",
  "penny likes to skate. the four of us could double.",
  "what could be better?",
  "boy, he's really gone, isn't he?",
  "sorry, i'm moving slow.",
  "oh, hey, look, it's no big deal,",
  "grandpa, we need to go home, now.",
  "and good night to you, too, flora.",
  "do you have anything like that?",
  "i simply came in, picked up a tray and started working for the man.",
